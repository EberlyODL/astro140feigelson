<h2>Why Interstellar Space Travel is Hard</h2>

<p>I have chosen here to concentrate on a single spacecraft propulsion method here (matter-antimatter annihilation engines) and to think about the issue using elementary formulae from physics: &nbsp;t=d/v (time to travel = distance divided by velocity); a=v/t (acceleration is change in velocity over time); KE = 1/2 mv<sup>2</sup> (kinetic energy of a moving body is one-half the product of its mass and velocity squared); &nbsp;E=mc<sup>2</sup> (Albert Einstein's conversion between mass and energy, only achievable at extremely high temperatures or involving subatomic particles), and the `rocket equation' (not given here becuase it's a bit more complicated, but shows that it becomes exponentially more difficult to propel a spaceship when its mass is dominated by fuel).&nbsp; Please look at a more thorough discussion of <a href="/_legacy/astro140/interstellar_travel_crawford_1990.pdf">interstellar travel from this perspective by the Australian astrophysicist I.A. Crawford</a> (Quar. J. Royal Astro. Soc. 31, 377-400, 1990), but you are not responsible for understanding this entire article.</p>

<p>Recall from the Drake equation discussion that the distance to the nearest civilization or habitable planet is</p>

<center>
	<p>d = (2x10<sup>13</sup>/N)<sup>1/3</sup> parsecs,</p>
</center>

<p>where N is the number of civilizations or habitable planets in the Galaxy.&nbsp; Let's assume N~10<sup>6</sup>, which gives d = 300 parsecs ~ 1000 lightyears ~ 1x10<sup>19</sup> meters. [Exoplanetary research indicates that the number of Earth-like Habitable Planets is higher than this, but the Drake equation suggests number of current Intelligent Civilizations is lower than this; so N~10<sup>6</sup> seems like a reasonable middle ground.] &nbsp;</p>

<p>Our current spacecraft (e.g. Space Shuttle, probes to Jupiter and Saturn) travel at a speed around v = 10<sup>4</sup> m/s, so the travel time would be</p>

<center>
	<p>t = d/v = 1x10<sup>19</sup> m / 10<sup>4</sup> m/s = 1x10<sup>15</sup> sec ~ 30 million years.</p>
</center>

<p>This is far too long to be convenient for human beings! The obvious solution is to develop rocket propulsions that give faster speeds, say 10% of the speed of light: &nbsp;v = 0.1 c = 3x10<sup>7</sup> m/s.&nbsp;&nbsp; Now the travel time would be</p>

<center>
	<p>t = 1x10<sup>19</sup> m / 3x10<sup>7</sup> m/s = 3x10<sup>11</sup> s = 10 thousand years,</p>
</center>

<p>which is still very long but not inconceivable.</p>

<p>Let's check whether the human body can tolerate the acceleration and deceleration up to these speeds.&nbsp; A spacecraft acceleration equivalent to the gravitational acceleration we feel on Earth's surface would be a ~ v/t ~ 10 m/s<sup>2</sup>.&nbsp; To reach a speed of v=0.1c would take</p>

<center>
	<p>t ~ v / a = 3x10<sup>7</sup> m/s / 10 m/s<sup>2</sup> = 1 month,</p>
</center>

<p>which is no problem.</p>

<p>Now let's check the power requirements.&nbsp; Assume the spacecraft has a mass of 100 tons, equivalent to a dozen trucks.&nbsp; Its kinetic energy is</p>

<center>
	<p>E = 1/2 m v<sup>2</sup> = 1/2 (1x10<sup>5</sup> kg) (3x10<sup>7</sup> m/s)<sup>2</sup> = 5x10<sup>19</sup> watt-sec.</p>
</center>

<p>The engine power must thus be at least</p>

<center>
	<p>E / t = 5x10<sup>19</sup> watt-s / 3x10<sup>10</sup> s ~ 2000 megawatts,</p>
</center>

<p>comparable to big modern power stations. (Here I've assumed acceleration for 1/10th of the 10<sup>4</sup> year trip.) This doesn't seem too difficult.</p>

<p>But how do we produce so much power for 10<sup>4</sup> years from such a small mass? The most efficient source of energy is to tap Einstein's equivalence of mass and energy, E=mc<sup>2</sup>.&nbsp; We need</p>

<center>
	<p>m = E / c<sup>2</sup> ~ 5x10<sup>19</sup> watt-s / (3x10<sup>8</sup> m/s)<sup>2</sup> = 500 kg,</p>
</center>

<p>which is within our mass limit.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But the only efficient way we know to derive this energy is from the annihilation of matter and anti-matter, and we have not been able to make and transport more than infinitisimal (<<<1 gm) quantities of anti-matter. Fermilab's Main Injector can accumulate ~10<sup>-8</sup> g of antiprotons/year. If Fermilab uses ~10<sup>-4</sup> of modern society's energy resources for 10<sup>9</sup> years to fuel our spaceship. This is reduced to ~10<sup>5</sup> years if one could tap all of the solar energy incident on the Earth's surface, and less if one could build a Ringworld or a Dyson sphere to trap a greater fraction of their Sun's energy output. The antiprotons produced must then be cooled with electrons in magnetic traps and (perhaps) stored as solid antihydrogen until needed for flight propulsion. See the analysis <a href="http://www.engr.psu.edu/antimatter/Papers/anti_prod.pdf">Production and trapping of antimatter for space propulsion applications</a> by (former-PSU Physics professor) G. A. Smith & colleagues.</p>

<p>Crawford makes a similar (but better!) calculation of a spaceship using antimatter drives in his section 4. &nbsp;Note that I ignored the question of how to actually produce thrust from matter-antimatter annihilation; Crawford argues that the annihilating particles should be surrounded by ordinary matter (say, water that Crawford calls the `reaction fluid') that absorbs the products (pions, muons and positrons) of the annihilations, heats and evaporates (makes steam) &nbsp;giving a jet of ordinary atoms to thrust the spaceship forward. &nbsp;Now the spaceship weighs more (carrying tons of reaction fluid), so more than a few hundred kilograms of antimatter is needed to power the trip. &nbsp;Crawford solves the rocket equation (eq. 1-9). &nbsp;Crawford and others don't think the antimatter drive is feasible because we can't make enough antimatter, and they prefer light sail technologies.</p>

<div><b>Conclusion: </b>The distances between existing intelligent civilizations is likely to be >1000 light years, although the distance to the nearest Earth-like Habitable Planet might be as little as ~10-100 lightyears.&nbsp; It is physically possible for a civilization&nbsp; to travel such distances if the travel time is long (say 10<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;yrs).&nbsp; But it is very difficult (orders of magnitude byond our current societal capability) to produce the necessary antimatter fuel, or the necessary laser power for light sails. As such, designing a space ship that can reach other stars in a human lifetime is not possible for our society at present, but it is also not ruled out by any laws of physics.</div>
