<p>Our discussion of Life in the Universe during Week 15 will be conducted on the course ANGEL page. &nbsp;You will see four Discussion Forum Topics where I have started the discussion with my thoughts. &nbsp;Your assignment for Week 15 is to read Scharf sections 10.5-10.6, and to contribute to the ANGEL Discussion Forums. &nbsp;Please add your ideas as responses to my four topics (do not add entirely new topics). &nbsp;In addition to stimulating the discussion, my thoughts also represent a summary of the course contents that may be useful in organizing your study for the Final Exam.</p>
