<p>This course uses three interfaces. &nbsp;</p>
<p>1. For quizzes, exams, discussions, submission of the project and papers, as well as e-mail communication and Course Announcements, the course will use the <a href="http://canvas.psu.edu" target="_blank">Canvas Course Management System</a>.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;The interface that you are currently using will help to&nbsp;organize and deliver much of the course content, through a combination of web pages and videos. We will refer to this interface as the Course Content Website (CCW). &nbsp;You can bookmark it at&nbsp;<a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&q=https://courses.ed.science.psu.edu/astro140/&source=gmail&ust=1470243355983000&usg=AFQjCNGc8NsSaRTWd1hnKubHN31aSnhmvA" href="https://courses.ed.science.psu.edu/astro140/" target="_blank">https://courses.ed.science.<wbr>psu.edu/astro140/</a>&nbsp;or access each lesson from the corresponding module inside Canvas.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;Roughly once a week, the instructor will provide brief videos discussing the upcoming course content, discussing results of recent quizzes or other material, or some particular issue about the class. &nbsp;These videos will be provided through the Voicethread system at Penn State; see <a href="http://voicethread.psu.edu/voicethread-student-quick-start-guide/">here</a> for an introduction. &nbsp;The videos will appear in your Web browser within the lecture pages. In some cases, you may need to reload a page in order for the video to update. While you shouldn't need to enter the Voicethread system directly each week, you can via <a href="https://psu.voicethread.com/myvoice/group/1159117" target="_blank">https://psu.voicethread.com/myvoice/group/1159117</a>. <strong>Note that at the beginning of the semester, you must join the Voicethread `group' for our class &nbsp;at the following URL:&nbsp;<a href="https://psu.voicethread.com/groups/subscribe/1159117/84507bce3/" target="_blank">https://psu.voicethread.com/groups/subscribe/1159117/84507bce3/</a> .</strong></p>
<p>It is important that you make sure that you are able to access this course via all three interfaces. &nbsp;</p>
<p><br>At the top of all of the course pages in the CCW, you will notice a icon&nbsp;with a picture of a book and the word outline, which you can click to access a&nbsp;menu for the course content that lives within the CCW. &nbsp;As you progress through the content, the menu expands to the right, creating breadcrumbs for you to navigate back through the content. You may also use the buttons at the bottom of your screen.</p>
<p>You will navigate to Canvas (<a href="http://canvas.psu.edu" target="_blank">canvas.psu.edu</a>) anytime you are required to complete a quiz, participate in a Discussion Forum, or submit your paper or project. &nbsp;The content is arranged by Modules/Lessons.</p>
<p>There may be times (e.g., near assignment deadlines) when&nbsp;it is important that you notice messages sent to your Canvas account promptly. &nbsp;Therefore, many students choose to&nbsp;configure their Canvas email account to forward messages to an email or SMS account. &nbsp; See 'Account' in the left menu and then 'Settings.'&nbsp; In the far right menu, you can add emails or SMS contacts. (If you go back to&nbsp;the 'Account' link in the left menu, then you can&nbsp;adjust your 'Notifications'&nbsp;to send a copy of all of your course emails to your active personal email address, be it your PSU email or other personal account. &nbsp; Note that messages sent via Canvas may include discussion of your course grades. &nbsp;If you choose to forward&nbsp;these messages to accounts outside of Canvas, then you may be compromising the privacy of such information.) &nbsp;</p>
<p>Remember to logout of the Astro&nbsp;140&nbsp;course content site and&nbsp;Canvas when you are done. The correct logout is important if you use a computer shared by many users (such as in computer labs) to prevent unauthorized access to your account and personal information such as grades. &nbsp;Closing the browser tab or the browser window&nbsp;DOES&nbsp;NOT&nbsp;terminate the connection - “logging out” is important to preserve your privacy and&nbsp;work.</p>
