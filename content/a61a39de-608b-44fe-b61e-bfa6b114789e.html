<p>In a regular telescope, the image of a star is blurred by fluctuations in Earth's upper atmosphere by about 1 arcsecond. Except for the very nearest stars, the faint light from any orbiting planets will lie within this bright blur, and thus be undetectable. &nbsp;Several technologies have (or still are) emerged in recent years to improve this situation:</p>
<ul><li><em><strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptive_optics" target="_blank">Adaptive optics</a></strong></em> is a complicated process whereby a flexible glass mirror in the telescope's optics is rapidly deformed (bent) to compensate for the atmospheric fluctuations. &nbsp;This greatly improves the effective focus of the image.</li><li>A <strong><em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronograph" target="_blank">coronograph</a></em></strong> is introduced into the optical system of the camera, placing an opaque dot on the star image. This allows faint light from orbiting planets to be see without the glare of the host star.</li><li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interferometry" target="_blank"><em><strong>Interferometry</strong></em></a> is a sophisticated technique whereby the star is imaged by two closely-space telescopes, and the signal is processed to "null" (essentially, erase) the stellar image, leaving faint emission from any planets. &nbsp;A $1 billion <a href="http://science.nasa.gov/missions/sim/" target="_blank">NASA space mission</a> was under development using this technique, but has been cancelled due to technical difficulties and cost overruns.</li></ul>
<p>These methods have been successful in detecting&nbsp;<a href="http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/?f=%22imaging%22+IN+detection" target="_blank">several dozen planets</a> around other stars. &nbsp;This method can only find planets that are quite distant from the star, typically 20-100 AU (Astronomical Unit = Earth-Sun distance). &nbsp;The most remarkable case is HR 8799, a nearby star with about 2 solar masses and 4 orbiting planets ... over years, we have direct images that show the planets orbiting the star! &nbsp;These planets have been imaged&nbsp;both with NASA's Hubble Space Telescope in space and with active optics coronagraphs on mountaintop telescopes. &nbsp;</p>
