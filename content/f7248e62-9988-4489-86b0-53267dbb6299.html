<p>Here we tell a remarkable story. &nbsp;From an astronomical perspective, Earth has the wrong atmosphere! Where does its oxygen come from? What happened to its carbon dioxide? What role did life play in changing the atmosphere billions of years ago ... and what role is it playing today? &nbsp;This topic is perhaps the only time when our "Life in the Universe" studies address issues of great concern to public welfare.</p>

<p>Let us compare the three principal terrestrial planets: Venus, Earth, and Mars. &nbsp;Each has a layer of volatile gases, liquids or solids on their solid surface. This is called the&nbsp;<em><strong>atmosphere</strong></em>&nbsp;of the planet. If the solar nebula theory for the origin of the solar system is right, then the atmospheres should have basically the same composition since they formed from the same protoplanetary disk material. But they don't!</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Venus:</strong> 96% CO<sub>2,</sub>&nbsp;3% N<sub>2</sub>, 1% H<sub>&nbsp;2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Earth:</strong> 0.02-0.7%&nbsp;CO<sub>2&nbsp;</sub>(range over past 0.5 GYr),&nbsp;78% N<sub>2</sub>, 21% O<sub>2</sub>, + lots of liquid/ice H<sub>2</sub>O&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Mars:</strong> 96% CO<sub>2</sub>, 3% N<sub>2</sub>, 1% Argon + lots of ice CO<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;& H<sub>2</sub>O<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Ices/gases in outer solar system and interstellar medium:</strong>&nbsp;H<sub>2</sub>, He, CO, CH<sub>4</sub>, NH<sub>3</sub>&nbsp;and H<sub>2</sub>O.</p>

<p>Planetary astronomers have developed a complicated scenario to explain why the planet atmospheres differ so much from the original solar nebula material.</p>
<p><em><strong>Phase I: </strong></em>Planets form by gravitational collapse in protoplanetary disk around young Sun, 4.5 billion years ago.&nbsp;&nbsp;The H and He gas that dominates the disk gas rapidly escapes (evaporates) from the inner planets due to their weak gravity and high temperatures.&nbsp;Only Jupiter and Saturn are massive enough, and cold enough, to retain the light hydrogen and helium atoms. Heavier molecules with oxygen, nitrogen and/or carbon can be retained by Venus/Earth/Mars. The smallest bodies like Mercury/Moon/asteroids cannot retain any gaseous atmosphere.</p>
<p><em><strong>Phase II:</strong></em> CO<sub>2</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>O, NH<sub>3</sub>&nbsp;are released from the molten interiors of the planets by outgassing, including&nbsp;volcanism, geysers, and hydrothermal vents. Water can also be deposited on the surface by collisions with comets and asteroids.&nbsp;(There is still significant debate among scientists on&nbsp;the relative contribution of outgassing and comets or asteroids to Earth's ocean water.)</p>
<ul><li>On all three planets, NH<sub>3</sub>&nbsp;is split by the Sun's ultraviolet light, the H atoms escape and the N atoms form N<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;gas which we now see in all three planetary atmospheres.</li><li>On hot Venus, H<sub>2</sub>O is a gas (steam) and is destroyed by solar UV light like NH<sub>3</sub>. On moderate-temperature Earth, H<sub>2</sub>O is a liquid (water) or solid (ice) and collects into oceans and polar ice caps. On cold Mars, H<sub>2</sub>O is entirely solid and resides in polar ice caps (and possibly permafrost below the surface)&nbsp;</li></ul>
<p style="text-align: center; "><img alt="Diagram of the process by which ultraviolet light from the Sun dissociates (breaks apart) molecules like water and ammonia." class="lightbox" src="/_legacy/astro140/uvdissoc.gif" style="width: 45%;"></p>
<ul><li>On Venus and Mars, the CO<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;is unchanged and remains the dominant gas constituent of the atmosphere. But on Earth the CO<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;gradually dissolves in the liquid water oceans (CO<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;+ H<sub>2</sub>O ---> H<sub>2</sub>CO) where it combines with other molecules to form solid minerals (e.g. CaCO<sub>3</sub>, limestone). These reactions proceed both by inorganic chemical reactions and by living organisms (e.g. diatoms and mollusk shells in shallow seas form thick layers of limestome). The atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;thus enters into the Earth's crust, where it is gradually is pushed into the Earthâ€™s mantle in subduction zones by plate tectonics. Thus Earth alone has seen most of its CO<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;transported from its atmosphere into&nbsp;its interior.</li></ul>
<ul><li>On Mars, much of the atmosphere is eroded by the solar wind. Some of this is simply due to the&nbsp;weaker gravity due to its lower mass. &nbsp;Some of the atmospheric loss is likely due to the lack of a protective magnetic field (today). &nbsp;It's thought that Mars once had a liquid core to generate a magnetic field, but since Mars was smaller, it cooled more rapidly and lost its magnetic field. &nbsp;Some combination of those factors (and perhaps others) has resuled in a modern&nbsp;Mars with a very thin atmosphere.</li></ul>
<p><em><strong>Phase III</strong>&nbsp;<strong>(only on Earth)</strong></em>: Living organisms produce O<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;on Earth. Free oxygen is difficult to form by inorganic chemistry and is very reactive with other molecules. But it is released in large quantities by green plants which undergo&nbsp;<em><strong>photosynthesis</strong></em>&nbsp;:</p>
<p align="center">6 CO<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;+ 6 H<sub>2</sub>O + solar light &nbsp; &nbsp;---> &nbsp;&nbsp; C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub>&nbsp;+ 6 O<sub>&nbsp;2</sub></p>
<p>Thus green plants have altered physical conditions on Earth in a very significant way, consuming the CO<sub>2 </sub>and releasing abundant O<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;in our atmosphere.&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result, nearly all of the Earth's CO<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;has been depleted, and&nbsp;it constitutes only <0.1%&nbsp;of the atmosphere today. &nbsp;Note that some living organisms benefit from this atmospheric change: &nbsp;metabolic animals like humans breathe the oxygen, and eat the sugars and other organic molecules formed by green plants, drink the water from the atmosphere, and release some CO<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;back to the atmosphere.</p>
<p><em><strong>Phase IV&nbsp;</strong></em><strong>(only on Earth):</strong>&nbsp; During the past ~300 years, human industrial society has been releasing CO<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;into the atmosphere by burning fossil fuels: coal, oil and methane (natural gas). These fuels are the buried remains of photosynthetic plants which lived 10<sup>7-8</sup>&nbsp;years ago. This rapid resupply of CO<sub>2&nbsp;</sub>has increased the atmosphere's CO<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;from 0.028% to <a href="https://www.co2.earth/" target="_blank">0.041% today</a> and it is projected to&nbsp;grow substantially in the 21st century and beyond.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><br>The Greenhouse Effect</h2>
<p>All molecules have quantized rotational and vibrational transitions. The molecule CO<sub>&nbsp;2</sub>&nbsp;happens to have the following quantum properties: it is transparent to visible light (i.e. most of the Sun's T~6000 K blackbody light) but strongly absorbs infrared light (i.e. most of a planet's T~300 K blackbody light). So CO<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;in a planet's atmosphere acts as a blanket keeping heat in. This `greenhouse effect' is strongest on Venus, which has an extremely hot surface due to its dense CO<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;atmosphere.&nbsp;&nbsp;But it is also present on Earth and Mars.&nbsp;&nbsp;On Mars, increased CO<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;from Olympus Mons and the other 3 volcanoes ~2-3 billion years ago probably led to the warming that produced the rivers and seas which are now cold and dry. &nbsp;On Earth, roughly 90% of the infrared radiation from the Earth's surface is absorbed by the atmosphere. &nbsp;It is eventually re-radiated out to space, but is causes a substantial warming of the surface by trapping the radiation so efficiently. &nbsp;</p>
<p><em><strong>Question: Will the rise in Earth's CO<sub>2&nbsp;</sub>due to human industrial activity cause a global warming of the Earth's surface?</strong></em></p>
<p>This is one of the most important scientific questions of our time. There is now a broad consensus among climate scientists that global temperatures are indeed rising since&nbsp;the late 20th century, and that this is due to the rapid reintroduction of CO<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;by fossil fuel burning.&nbsp;&nbsp;Due to the long residence time of in the atmosphere before it is absorbed into the oceans (~1000 years), the CO<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;concentration is projected to&nbsp;continue to rise into the foreseeable future. &nbsp;The increases are likely to be even greater&nbsp;due to increasing or even accelerating CO<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;production as more societies "moderize" and use more fossil fuels per capita. &nbsp;Up-to-date information on climate issues can be found at the&nbsp;latest (2014) reports of the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.ipcc.ch/" target="_blank">Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change</a>;&nbsp;see the&nbsp;<a href="http://ar5-syr.ipcc.ch/" target="_blank">synthesis report</a>&nbsp;where the figures here were obtained. &nbsp;Penn State's&nbsp;Professor Richard Alley, and several other Penn State faculty, are principal authors of the IPCC report. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The&nbsp;figure below&nbsp;shows the rise&nbsp;in&nbsp;CO<sub>2 </sub> production over the past ~250&nbsp;years due to modern industrial society.&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="Figure showing the rise in CO_2 production over the past ~250 years due to modern industrial society." src="https://courses.ed.science.psu.edu/astro140/sites/courses/ed/astro140/files/mooc_images/anthro-co2.jpg" style="width: 676px; height: 338px; "></p>
<p>The panels&nbsp;below present the manifestations of the resulting increased greenhouse effect and global warming: the temperature of the atmosphere at the Earth's surface (both global and regional), the melting of ices at the poles (similar melting of glaciers is seen in mountain ranges and Greenland), and the rise of the average sea level. &nbsp;The relationships between greenhouse gases rise and global warming is&nbsp;complicated; for instance, the warmer oceans evaporate faster, leading to more clouds where are generally reflect sunlight back into space, which cools the Earth.&nbsp;&nbsp;But the total effect is a net heating of 1-2 watts per square meter, and industrial human processes dominate the heating. &nbsp;The total sunlight energy is 1400 W/m<sup>2</sup>, and&nbsp;the net heating is 1-2 W/m<sup>2</sup>, roughly 0.1% of the Sun's energy on the Earth. &nbsp;</p>

<p>An increase of&nbsp;~0.1% of the total, does not seem very big. &nbsp;However, and unfortunately, both measured evidence and detailed calculations indicate that this small heating has rather considerable effects on things we care about, such as the sea level, agricultural zones, storms, fresh water and deserts. &nbsp;And the effects in the near future ... in&nbsp;your lifetimes during the 21st century ... are predicted to be strong.&nbsp;&nbsp;The figures below show global and regional changes expected up to 2100 for two models: one&nbsp;(RCP6.0) where the world's greenhouse emission is sharply curtailed, and another (RCP8.5) where it continues to grow without check. &nbsp;&nbsp; For the latter model,&nbsp;the average warming is 4 degrees C (7 degrees F)&nbsp;but the effect is not evenly distributed across the globe.&nbsp;The strongest heating is in the Arctic region, and there is great concern that the melting of permafrost in the tundra of Siberia and Canada may release yet more greenhouse gases, particularly methane. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Making predictions about the future of a complex system like the Earth is always difficult. &nbsp;Nevertheless, it is important that scientists provide society and policy makers with their best assessments based on the data and models avaliable. Some of&nbsp;the potential consequences are so severe, that they could have significant implications for society at large and particularly&nbsp;people living in areas likely to be affected by flooding or extreme weather. &nbsp;Examples of&nbsp;some potential&nbsp;consequences that have been predicted include:</p>
<ul><li>Sea levels are projected to rise 0.4-0.9 meters over the next century, due to thermal expansion of the oceans and partial melting of the polar ice caps.&nbsp;&nbsp;On longer timescales, the Greenland ice sheet may melt entirely, leading to 7-meter rise in sea levels.&nbsp;&nbsp;Coastal cities (NYC, Philadelphia, Washington D.C.,&nbsp;Los Angeles, New Orleans in US; Shanghai, Tokyo, Calcutta, etc) and low-lying areas (nearly all of&nbsp;Florida, Netherlands, Bangladesh, etc) would be flooded.&nbsp;</li><li>Glaciers continue to shrink, winter snows reduce, and Arctic ice disappears in summer. &nbsp;These beginnings of these effects can be dramatically seen through time lapse photography, such as the <a href="http://extremeicesurvey.org/" target="_blank">Extreme Ice Project</a>.&nbsp;</li><li>Weather extremes (droughts, floods, hot spells) are projected to increase.&nbsp;Hurricanes become stronger because warmer air stores more energy and moisture.&nbsp;&nbsp;Regional weather patterns, such as rainfall, will change. &nbsp;There may be some advanages&nbsp;(e.g., opening of a Northwestet package through the Artic Ocean), but there will also likely be some people who are affected adversely. &nbsp;</li><li>Agricultural zones are projected to shift towards poles. Tropical diseases such as malaria and cholera are projected to expand to new areas.&nbsp;&nbsp;Extinctions of plant/animal species as habitats warm (already happening with coral reefs and other fragile environments).&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Oceans currents may&nbsp;change. &nbsp;There is worry that the Gulf Stream which warms Europes may reverse. &nbsp;This has happened in the past (long before people were around to farm) and could be devestating to agricultural economies and perhaps the global food supply.</li></ul>
<blockquote>The effects of global warming are particularly evident in the rapid reduction of ice coverage at the Earth's polar and high mountain ragions. See short videos of the 10-year recession of a glacier near Juneau Alaska &nbsp;<a href="https://vimeo.com/168243535" target="_blank">here</a> and warming at Glacier National Park in Montana <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur4I8tYnxP4" target="_blank"> here</a>.

The Antarctic ice has been less affected, but its outer regions are recently decreasing (see <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnCa_4NFcUc" target="_blank">here</a>. On the timescale of one or more centuries, it is possible -- but still not well-established -- that all of the polar ice will melt. If this occurs,&nbsp;flooding of coastal cities around the world is likely, as shown in the video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbiRNT_gWUQ" target="_blank">here</a>.)</blockquote>

<p><em><strong>We thus see that the atmospheres of planets can change greatly, both from physical processes (such as the loss of water from Venus) and from biological processes (such as the increase of oxygen from green plants).</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>Modern human society is now increasing greenhouse gases in the atmosphere and, even though the quantities seem very small, it has increased the Earth's temperature perceptibly in recent decades. &nbsp;Ice is melting, ocean levels are rising, deserts are increasing. &nbsp;Climate scientists agree that&nbsp;the Earth's temperature will significantly more during the next centuries. &nbsp;Human society will make difficult choices about how to&nbsp;deal with the associated challenges. &nbsp;</strong></em></p>
