<p>On Earth, scientists study the complicated interactions in the world around us, often tracing `cycles' that show how some feature begins, develops, and ends. Some involve physical components (such as the `water cycle': evaporation of water from the oceans, with rain and rivers bringing water back, while some is captured in glaciers and ice caps) while others involve living organisms (such as the life cycle of a human from birth through childhood, adulthood, aging, and death). Similarly, astronomers can trace the physical cycles and interactions in a Galaxy, and of its components (such as the interstellar medium, stars and planets). Here we discuss the life cycle of individual stars. Stars are crucial for life in the universe, as without their heat, planets would be much too cold to sustain life.</p>
<h2>Star Formation</h2>
<p>We have seen that, in a spiral galaxy like the Milky Way, a complicated `interstellar medium' resides in the space between stars. It consists of gases (mostly hydrogen and helium from the Big Bang, with a soup of interesting molecules) and tiny solid `dust grains' (some made of rock like tiny sand grains, others made of carbon like soot). As a spiral arm passes through a region in the Galaxy, the interstellar material is compressed and dark cold clouds form. When a cloud of interstellar medium is dense enough, gravity locally dominates other forces and a star forms by `gravitational collapse'. Material with too much spin forms a flattened disk orbiting the protostar; this is the `protoplanetary disk' where planets form. The star and disk formation process is complicated, and astrophysical modeling is underway. <em><strong>Thus stars, planets, and any life on these planets inherit their molecules from the interstellar medium. </strong></em></p>
<blockquote><p>Look at the recent <a href="http://www.astro.ex.ac.uk/people/mbate/Cluster/pr.html">computer simulations of the star formation process</a> in a small interstellar cloud by Matthew Bate. The gas in the cloud starts off with random swirling motions known as `turbulence'. Then some clumps undergo gravitational collapse forming stars (white dots), but gas continues to collect. Some stars form in isolation with their disks, but many interact with other young stars and disks in complex ways. A large fraction of stars remain in binary systems. Many stars form in large molecular clouds where hundreds or thousands of stars form together as a <a href="http://www.astro.ex.ac.uk/people/mbate/Cluster/Animations/ClusterXT1810Z_H264B_s.mov">star cluster</a>. Here too individual stars often have protoplanetary disks. We will study protoplanetary disks later in the course to understand how diverse types of planetary systems form; this is needed to evaluate how many planets could harbor life similar to Earth's.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Stages of Stellar Evolution</h2>
<p>Once formed in a molecular cloud, the individual star goes through four major phases of evolution: - `pre-main sequence' powered by release of energy from the gravitational collapse;</p>
<ul><li>`main sequence' powered by fusion of hydrogen to helium in the core;</li><li>`red giant' powered by fusion of helium to elements up to iron;</li><li>`death processes'. The outer layers of the red giant stars are ejected, slowly or violently, and the inner core becomes one of three types of compact star (`white dwarf', `neutron star', or `black hole').</li></ul>
<p>The observational evidence for the evolution of a star is often shown on the Hertzsprung-Russell (H-R) diagram. Here we plot the luminosity of the star on the vertical axis (actually, the log of the luminosity since the range of luminosities is so huge), and the surface temperature on the horizontal axis. Recall that `luminosity' has units of energy per second, and measures the intrinsic light output or `power' of a star. A common unit of luminosity is the `watt'; we might have a 60 watt lightbulb in our room, while the Sun today emits 4x10<sup>27</sup> watts. A protostar in a molecular cloud has a relatively cool surface but is quite luminous, and thus appears in the upper-right part of the H-R diagram. It quickly (not too quickly â€¦. for a 1 M<sub>o</sub> star like the Sun, in ~10 million years) loses power but heats its surface, moving downward and to the left on the diagram below (left).</p>

<p>When the star reaches the main sequence where the core temperature exceeds ~13 million degrees Kelvin, nuclear reactions begin in the core that fuse hydrogen to helium. In most stars, this is through the `proton-proton chain' with intermediary steps involving rare isotopes of hydrogen and helium. As over 70% of the star is hydrogen, there is a vast supply of fuel for this reaction, keeping stars on the main sequence for (in most cases) billions of years. This is the most stable and long-lived phase of stellar evolution. Our Sun today has been on the main sequence for 4.5 billion years, and will continue hydrogen-to-helium burning steadily for ~6 billion years more. Below is an artist's conception of the interior of the Sun and many other similar main sequence stars.</p>

<h2>Red giant stars: `We are starstuff!' (Carl Sagan)</h2>
<p>The red giant phase is particularly important for understanding the origin of elements needed for planets and living organisms. When hydrogen is depleted in the core of the main sequence star (that is, when the core is entirely helium), nuclear burning continues in a shell around the core. When the core reaches ~120 million degrees Kelvin, then helium is not longer stable and can react with itself to form heavier elements.</p>
<p>First, the helium flash initiates the reaction</p>
<p></p>
<center><p>3 <sup>4</sup>He ---> <sup>12</sup>C + 2 gamma-rays</p>
<p></p>
<p>Stars like the Sun will then burn hydrogen to helium in a shell around the core where helium is burning to carbon. &nbsp;The star becomes very luminous but the outer layers swell to huge radii and cool. &nbsp;The star thus moves upward and to the right in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img alt="Diagram of the interior of the Sun as a red giant" class="lightbox" src="https://courses.ed.science.psu.edu/_legacy/astro140/fg12_07.jpg" style="cursor: default; width: 226px; height: 215px;">&nbsp; &nbsp;<img alt="Hertzsprung-Russell diagram of the evolution of the Sun after the main sequence." class="lightbox" src="https://courses.ed.science.psu.edu/_legacy/astro140/fg12_10.jpg" style="cursor: default; width: 222px; height: 208px;"></p></center>
<p>Cores of more massive stars (5-100 M<sub>o</sub>) will be hot enough to burn carbon and other elements up to iron:</p>
<center><p><sup>12</sup>C + <sup>4</sup>He ---> <sup>16</sup>O<br><sup>16</sup>O + <sup>4</sup>He ---> <sup>20</sup>Ne<br>and similar reactions give <sup>24</sup>Mg, <sup>28</sup>Si, <sup>32</sup> S, ..., <sup>56</sup>Fe (iron).</p></center>
<p>These rare high-mass stars become supergiants, the most luminous stars in the Galaxy, during their brief red giant phases. Several nuclear reactions can occur simultaneously in the core and shells around the core (like layers of an onion; see diagram below). Each nuclear reaction releases more energy, so the stars becomes more and more luminous. These are the massive supergiants with luminosities L ~ 10<sup>5</sup>-10<sup>6</sup> L<sub>o</sub>.</p>
<p><img alt="Diagram of the interior of a massive star (M>10 solar masses) as a red supergiant." class="lightbox" src="https://courses.ed.science.psu.edu/_legacy/astro140/fg12_17.jpg" style="width: 222px; height: 192px;"></p>
<p>Iron is the last element that can be made in this fashion because it is the most stable nucleus.&nbsp; That is, any nuclear reaction involving iron requires more enegy than it emits.&nbsp; Iron is thus the end-product of normal stellar nucleosynthesis.</p>
<p>The synthesis of nuclei in red giants/supergiants explains the relative abundances of different elements in the Universe.&nbsp; The plot below shows that, after hydrogen &&nbsp;helium, the most abundant elements in the Sun are the even-numbered elements between 6 and 26 protons: C, O, Ne, Mg, ... Fe.&nbsp; Note also the rarity of elements heavier than iron. Similar abundances of the elements are seen in other stars, the Galaxy's interstellar medium, Jupiter and elsewhere. This universal pattern is powerful evidence for the theory of red giant stars, and implies that red giants are the main source of elements with 6-26 protons in the Universe.</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="Plot of the relative abundances of the elements in the Universe today.  H and He come from the Big Bang, C through Fe are produced in red giant stars, and the rare heavy elements come from supernova explosions." class="lightbox" src="https://courses.ed.science.psu.edu/_legacy/astro140/elements.jpg" style="width: 350px; height: 285px;"></p>
<p>How do these atoms formed inside red giant stars get out into the Galaxy? Convection (like boiling) in red giants brings these heavier elements produced in the interior to the surface. There they condense into tiny solid particles of rock (typically Mg-Si-O mixtures) and carbon which are pushed outward into space by the starlight. These explain the interstellar dust particles, which scatter and redden light in the Milky Way. &nbsp;Later, the gas and dust ejected by red giant stars enter cold molecular clouds, where it undergoes gravitational collapse and forms new stars and planets.</p>
<p><b>Thus, the Earth, you and I are composed of C/N/O/Si/Fe/... atoms that were created in red giant stars before our solar system was born.&nbsp;</b>The atoms were formed by nuclear reactions in the giant/supergiant phase, ejected into the interstellar medium in both gaseous and solid form, and later incorporated into the solar system, the biosphere and ourselves.</p>

<h2>Summary: The astronomical context for life</h2>
<p>In this introductory portion of the course, we have found that normal galaxies, forming in complicated ways billions of years ago after the Big Bang, form stars and planets continuously from their interstellar medium. The stars produce elements heavier than helium by nuclear fusion, and these atoms are ejected into the galaxy's interstellar medium. More stars and planets form in the cold interstellar clouds, now enriched with atoms from the furnaces in stars. These atoms combined to form a wide variety of molecules, many containing carbon. Interstellar clouds can be viewed as a laboratory of organic molecules diluted in the dominant hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>) and helium from the Big Bang. These chemicals are familiar to us -- water, molecules in Earth's atmosphere (O<sub>2</sub>, N<sub>2</sub>, CO<sub>2</sub>), methane and other hydrocarbons, alcohols and sugars. These are the molecules we see in our daily lives on the surface of Earth, the same molecules necessary for living organisms on Earth. We thus have traced profound links between the Universe, the galaxies, the stars, the interstellar medium, star and planet formation, and life on Earth. While some of this story was known ~50 years ago and Carl Sagan outlined it for the public ~30 years ago, many of the findings are very recent. Understanding the molecular universe, in particular, is a strong motivation for the most modern (and expensive) telescopes of the past ~10 years such as the Spitzer and Herschel Space Telescopes and the ALMA in Chile.</p>
