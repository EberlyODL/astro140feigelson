<h2>The expanding Universe</h2>
<p>In the 1920s, the astronomer Edwin Hubble (shown below left) and others &nbsp;obtained spectra of these galaxies to measure their motions towards or away from us based on the Doppler shift. To everyone's amazement, nearly all galaxies showed a redshift indicating they are all moving away from us. Furthermore, the redshift is greater for more distant galaxies, following a linear relationship v = H<sub style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; ">o</sub>&nbsp;d (Hubble's law). Hubble's original data is shown below right; today we have millions of galaxy redshifts measured, extending the diagram to fainter magnitudes (rightward) and faster velocities (upward). &nbsp;&nbsp;The only reasonable interpretation for all galaxies moving away from us in a linear fashion is that space itself is expanding, much like the rubber surface on a balloon expands as it is inflated. &nbsp;By the middle of the 20th century, nearly all astronomers acknowledged that we reside in an expanding universe.</p>

First, in 1905, he showed that Newton's laws of motion do not hold when speeds approach the speed of light. He then struggled for a decade to understand gravity in this new context, emerging with the theory of General Relativity in 1915. Based on the view that massive bodies alter the geometry of 3-dimensional space-time, Einstein's General Relativity gives a full and accurate explanation of the gravitational attraction between bodies. The mathematics was quickly applied to the universe by others who&nbsp;found that the theory predicts that the Universe should not be static: it should either expand or contract following specific mathematical formulae. Remember that this is not a vague idea, but a rigorous&nbsp;mathematical derivation&nbsp;based on Einstein's General Relativity.</p>

They were working for Bell Laboratories (the U.S. telephone company) to investigate why static was present on long-distance telephone calls that used microwave signals. They found that the entire sky was the source of the radiation. &nbsp;The discovery of the CMB was a powerful confirmation of the Big Bang model for the expanding universe.</span></p>

<h2>The birth of galaxies</h2>
<p>Even though the Universe has been expanding since the Big Bang, dispersing the atoms and cooling the light, gravity is still present. On local scales, atoms attracted each other, forming early stars and then galaxies. We have little observational knowledge about this phase of the Universe's history, hence its nickname `the Dark Ages'. It lasted roughly from 1 million to 1 billion years after the Big Bang, or the first few percent of the Universe's current age. Astrophysicists argue that an early generation of stars formed during this time, quickly going supernova and polluting the gas with small amounts of elements heavier than helium. Detailed models show that gravitational attraction (involving both Dark Matter and regular matter) produced dense sheets and filaments that then collapsed to form galaxies and galaxy clusters. Big galaxies cannibalize smaller ones, and mergers of big galaxies are common. Massive black holes formed at the center of most galaxies at the same time.&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>Astrophysicists have taking the known laws of physics (gravitational attraction, gas dynamics) with the conditions emerging from the Big Bang to produce computer simulations of the formation of galaxies as the Universe expands and cools. These simulations are among the largest scientific calculations ever made.
