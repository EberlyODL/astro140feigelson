<h3>Cosmology: The story of the Universe</h3>
<p><span>We first lay the foundations of Life in the Universe by discussing the Universe as a whole, its origins in a Big Bang ~13 billion years ago and its history until the present day. Big Bang cosmology began in the early-20th century, was largely confirmed by the late-20th century, and is now in an era of detailed investigation, establishing the parameters of the model to ~1% precision. </span></p>
<p><span><span>Modern cosmology is full of unexpected and unintuitive features: a universal expansion (similar to blowing up a balloon); its contents dominated by mysterious Dark Matter and Dark Energy; a clear explanation for the formation of the simplest elements (hydrogen and helium), and the formation of stars and galaxies. </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>All societies have a cosmology â€¦ an explanation for the origin and development of the world around us. In many traditional cultures, the world is created by deities, gods and goddesses. The previous lecture outlined the rise of modern science, starting with Isaac Newton's mathematical relationships defining the motions and gravitational interactions of physical objects.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>A brilliant young scientist named <a href="http://www.aip.org/history/einstein/">Albert Einstein</a> made profound changes to Newtonian physics. First, in 1905, he showed that Newton's laws of motion do not hold when speeds approach the speed of light. He then struggled for a decade to understand gravity in his new context, emerging with the theory of General Relativity in 1915. Based on the view that massive bodies alter the geometry of 4-dimensional space-time, Einstein's General Relativity gives a full and accurate explanation of the gravitational attraction between bodies. The mathematics was quickly applied to the universe as a whole by the Russian physicist <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wnet/hawking/universes/html/fried.html">Alexander Friedmann</a> and Belgian astronomer Georges Lemaitre. He found that the theory predicts that the Universe should not be static: it should either expand or contract following specific mathematical formulae. Remember that this is not a vague idea, but a rigorous mathematical derivation based on Einstein's General Relativity. </span></span></p>

<p><span>In the early 20th century, astronomers knew only about stars relatively near the Sun in the Milky Way. But there were some blurry objects in the sky known as `nebulae'. Around 1920, a talented American astronomer names&nbsp;<a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/aso/databank/entries/bahubb.html" style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; ">Edwin Hubble</a>&nbsp;used a giant new telescope in California to obtain improved photographs of the nebulae. Some appeared to be huge, but very distant, structures similar to the Milky Way. With repeated observations of the nebula Messier 31 in the Andromeda constellation, Hubble demonstrated it was a distinct `island universe', or galaxy. He and others photographed many other galaxies.</span></p>
<p><span>Astronomers obtained spectra of these galaxies to measure their motions towards or away from us based on the Doppler shift. To everyone's amazement, nearly all galaxies showed a redshift indicating they are all moving away from us. Furthermore, the redshift is greater for more distant galaxies, following a linear relationship v = H<sub>o</sub> d (Hubble's law). The only reasonable interpretation for all galaxies moving away from us in a linear fashion is that space itself is expanding, much like the rubber surface on a balloon expands as it is inflated. The diagrams below show the original data available to Hubble, a modern dataset combining data from several methods for estimating galaxy distances, and the `raisin bread' analogy to explain the redshift law. By the middle of the 20th century, nearly all astronomers acknowledged that we reside in an expanding universe that follows the predictions of Einstein's General Relativity.</span></p>

<p><span>If the universe is really expanding, then the galaxies were closer together and the average density of matter was higher in the past. Extrapolating to earlier times, there must be some instant when the expansion began, after which the density of the universe was extremely high. High densities imply high temperatures for normal matter. When dense matter is hot it radiates light with a `blackbody' spectrum. So the expanding universe model predicts:</span></p>
<ul><li><p><span>the universe was formed in a Big Bang at a single instant. With the latest measurement of Hubble's contestant, H0=73 km/s/Mpc and other parameters, the Big Bang occurred about 13.7 billion years ago.</span></p></li><li><p><span>the early universe just after the Big Bang was filled with light and particles at extremely high temperatures</span></p></li><li><p><span>the Universe should be suffused with light from the Big Bang following a black body spectrum</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span>In the 1950s, physicist George Gamow calculated that the light from the Big Bang should cool as the universe expands, and should be a few degrees above absolute zero today. In the mid-1960s, this cosmic light was discovered, by accident, by Arno Pensias and Robert Wilson. They were working for Bell Laboratories (the U.S. telephone company) to investigate why static was present on long-distance telephone calls that used microwave signals. They found that the entire sky was the source of the radiation. This `cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation was immediately associated with Gamow's predicted light from the Big Bang.</span></p>
<p><span>The discovery of the CMB was a powerful confirmation of the Big Bang model for the expanding universe. It was found to have exactly a blackbody spectrum with T=2.735 K, about 3 degrees above absolute zero. Other predictions of the model were also validated during the 1960s-70s. Exactly 24% of the hydrogen was converted to helium, with trace amounts of deuterium, lithium and beryllium isotopes. The age of the oldest stars is close to the 13.7 billion years since the Big Bang.</span></p>
<p><span>Today, detailed studies of the CMB, galaxies, galaxy clusters, and other extragalactic phenomena (such as quasars and gravitational lensing) all support a particular version of the Big Bang model. Here only 4% of the `stuff' in the universe is regular matter: molecules made up of atoms, themselves made up of protons, neutrons and electrons. 72% is composed of a mysterious `Dark Energy' that is accelerating the universe's expansion, and 23% is comprised of a different mysterious Dark Matter that slows the expansion. However, many of these fascinating findings of modern cosmology do not directly affect our understanding of Life in the Universe. We will concern ourselves here only with regular matter from which stars, planets and biospheres are made.</span></p>
