<p>Sun, Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Asteroid Belt, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, Kuiper Belt Objects (including Pluto and other dwarf planets).&nbsp;Below are real-color images of the terrestrial planets (lwdr) and the Jovian planets (right) to scale.&nbsp; Note how Earth and Venus are about the same size, while the other terrestrial planets (including Moon) are smaller. Note how the outer planets are far bigger than the inner planets with Jupiter and Saturn the largest.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Visualize planetary orbits with a&nbsp;<a href="http://www.theplanetstoday.com/#" target="_blank">digital orrery</a>. First take a look at the configuration of the orbits right now. &nbsp;Then click on the arrow and then slide the green balls to change the speed, zoom and other characteristics of future motions. &nbsp;Note how the inner planets orbit faster ... this is Kepler's Third Law, P<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;= a<sup>3&nbsp;</sup>(the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the orbit size). &nbsp;While the terrestrial planets have few moons (Earth has one large moon, Mars has two small ones captured from the Asteroid Belt), the Jovian planets are orbited by an endless number of small bodies. &nbsp;See a table of 181&nbsp;named moons with links to photos and more information at the <a href="http://www.windows.ucar.edu/tour/link=/our_solar_system/moons_table.html" target="_blank">Windows to the Universe website</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn are easily seen with the naked eye and have been known since antiquity. In the late 1600s, Isaac Newton Laws of Motion and Gravity, combined with the methods of calculus he invented, gave a quantitative understanding of the elliptical orbits and masses of the planets and their moons. &nbsp;Uranus was discovered with a telescope by amateur German astronomer William Herschel in 1781, later appointed Royal Astronomer of England. Neptune was discovered in 1846 in France based on predictions using Newton's celestial mechanics. &nbsp;Uranus had a non-elliptical motion due to the pull of a then-unknown planet. The first asteroid in the Asteroid Belt between Mars and Jupiter, Ceres, was discovered by accident in 1801. &nbsp;Today, tens of thousands of asteroids have known orbits. &nbsp;&nbsp;Altogether, the discovery of the outer Solar System bodies caused tremendous excitement throughout Europe during the 18-19th centuries, giving confidence both in the improved technology of telescopes, in the theoretical predictions of Newton's "celestial mechanics," and in the rationality of the world around us.</p>
<p>Beyond Neptune are many minor bodies collectively known as Kuiper Belt Objects (KBOs), most discovered since the 1990s. The most famous is Pluto, discoveredi in the U.S. in 1930 based on perturbations of Uranus' orbit after long searching. Michael Brown (at Caltech in California) and Devid Jewitt (at the University of Hawaii) have found hundreds of KBOs, and new large surveys are planned to find many more.</p>
