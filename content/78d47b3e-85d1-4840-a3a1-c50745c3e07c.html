<h2>Major Bodies</h2>
<p>Sun, Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Asteroid Belt, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, Kuiper Belt Objects (including Pluto and other dwarf planets).&nbsp;Below are real-color images of the Sun (left only) and all the planets including the Jovian (gas giant) planets and the terrestrial planets. Note how Earth and Venus are about the same size, while the other terrestrial planets Mars and Mercury are smaller. Note how the outer gas giants are far bigger than the inner terrestrial planets, with Jupiter and Saturn dominating. &nbsp;The following composite image shows the Sun, planets and principal moons with correct scale in radius, although incorrect scale in orbital spacing. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn are easily seen with the naked eye and have been known since antiquity. In the late-1600s, Isaac Newton Laws of Motion and Gravity, combined with the methods of calculus he invented, gave a quantitative understanding of the elliptical orbits and masses of the planets and their moons. Uranus was discovered with a telescope by amateur German astronomer William Herschel in 1781, later appointed Royal Astronomer of England. &nbsp;Neptune was discovered in 1846 in France based on predictions using Newton's celestial mechanics. Astronomers detected small deviations in the Uranus from an ellipse and correctly inferred that the&nbsp;non-elliptical motion was due to the pull of a then-unknown planet. The first asteroid in the Asteroid Belt between Mars and Jupiter, Ceres, was discovered by accident in 1801. &nbsp;At the time they were considred new planets. &nbsp;Subsequently, tens of thousands of asteroids have been discovered and have well characterized orbits. &nbsp;Now, it's obvious that Ceres and other large asteroids fit are more naturally categorized as members of an asteroid belt&nbsp;than as planets. &nbsp;Altogether, the discovery of the outer Solar System bodies caused tremendous excitement throughout Europe during the 18th and 19th centuries, giving confidence both in the improved technology of telescopes, in the theoretical predictions of Newton's `celestial mechanics', and in the rationality of the world around us.</p>
<p>Beyond Neptune are many minor bodies collectively known as Kuiper Belt Objects (KBOs), most discovered since the 1990s. The most famous is Pluto, discovered in the U.S. in 1930 based on perturbations of Uranus' orbit after long searching. Michael Brown (at Caltech in California) and Devid Jewitt (at University of Hawaii) and others have found hundreds of KBOs, and new large surveys are planned to find many more. &nbsp;A few years ago, the International Astronomical Union `demoted' Pluto from `planet' to `drawf planet' status because several KBOs comparable or larger in size have been found.&nbsp;</p>
