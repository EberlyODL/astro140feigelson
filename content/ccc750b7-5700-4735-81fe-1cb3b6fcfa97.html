<h2>The Anthropic Principle</h2>

<p>For decades now, astrophysicists and physicists have been developing arguments about how the observed conditions of the physical Universe seem to be closely linked, in some particular ways, to the existence of living organisms such as ourselves. As we saw in the last page of notes on the nature of time, one of these arguments points out the extreme improbability of our universe's origin in its observed very low-entropy state. Separately, physicists have pointed out that the sizes, masses, and ages of objects we see (atoms, living organisms, planets, stars, galaxies, Universe) can all be derived, in an approximate fashion, by knowing the values of a few physical constants: the relative strengths of the gravitational, electrical, atomic, and nuclear forces; the relative masses of protons and electrons; and the key cosmological parameters of our universe. The existence of these objects thus places constraints on these elementary physical constants.</p>

<p>"The possibility of life as we know it evolving in the Universe depends on the values of a few basic physical constants -- and is in some respects remarkably sensitive to their numerical values."</p>

<p>(Carr & Rees, 1979)</p>

<p></p>

<p>For example, the existence of life on rocky (silicate) water-bearing planets like Earth requires that:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The universal expansion following the Big Bang is tuned to produce long-lived, gravitationally-collapsed structures.</li>
	<li>The ratio of light to particles in the Universe is sufficiently low to permit particles to form neutral atoms and permit gravitational collapse of stars.</li>
	<li>The constants of nuclear physics are tuned to give long-lived main sequence phases of stars and red giants that synthesize heavy elements.</li>
</ul>

<p>Together, such requirements place stringent constraints on the fundamental constants of nature, sometimes constraining them to with a few percent of their observed values. These arguments can be made in considerable detail. Here are some details:</p>

<ul>
	<li>If the expansion after the Big Bang was weaker than we observe (with other cosmological conditions left the same), then the Universe would have expanded only briefly before recollapsing, and long-lived stars and the planets orbiting them would not have had time to exist. On the other hand, if the Big Bang had been significantly stronger than it was, particles would have&nbsp;dispersed too far from one another too quickly for&nbsp;&nbsp;gravity to&nbsp;collect them into galaxies and stars. The "just right" early expansion that we observe&nbsp;requires a delicate balance between the effects of&nbsp;Dark Matter and Dark Energy.</li>
	<li>If the nuclear isotope of lithium <sup>3</sup>Li were stable, then the fusion of 4 <sup>1</sup>H --> 4He would proceed directly and quickly in the cores of stars, and the main sequence phase would not last billions of years.</li>
	<li>If the carbon nucleus <sup>12</sup>C had an energy state just below -- instead of just above -- the energy of a beryllium <sup>8</sup>Be energy state, then red giant nucleosynthesis would end at beryllium and heavier elements such as carbon or oxygen - necessary for life as we know it - would be extremely rare.</li>
	<li>If Newton's law of gravity were F = GMm/r<sup>2.1</sup> rather than GMm/r<sup>2.0</sup>&nbsp;(or any exponent other than exactly 2!),&nbsp;then there would be no stable orbits for&nbsp;planets around a star.</li>
</ul>

<p>These arguments are known collectively as the Anthropic Principle. Several variations are discussed (weak Anthropic Principle, strong Anthropic Principle, final Anthropic Principle, etc). Many scientists dislike these arguments intensely: they seem post hoc, that is, positing that the observed phenomena of the universe somehow "act backward in time" on its past conditions. How could the existence of humans 13 billion years after the formation of the Universe possibly affect the properties it had when it was formed?</p>

<p>But this is not actually what adherents of the Anthropic Principle propose. Rather, they suggest that we admit the possibility of there being many universes, each with different physical properties. Then, among the many universes of this "multiverse", life would exist only in those with the appropriate conditions; most probably, the vast majority of universes would not have any living inhabitants. This Multiverse or "Many Universes" Hypothesis is now considered seriously by theoretical physicists engaged in developing the latest theories of quantum relativity and inflationary cosmology. Perhaps universes emerge from some quantum foam? Perhaps the transition from inflation to ordinary expansion occurs differently in each region where it occurs, producing distinct Big Bangs (one per universe) with different properties? Perhaps there `are' (in some sense of existence) many Universes within which only a very few have the carefully tuned conditions necessary for life. Of course, if this is the case, it would not be surprising for us to find ourselves living in one of these rare Universes - just as it is not surprising that we find ourselves inhabiting a warm, stable world orbiting a single, steadily-burning star. In both cases, the "special" properties of our surroundings are in fact those that make our very existence possible.&nbsp;</p>
