<p>Our LUBS text gives an excellent and detailed treatment of the possibility of life on Mars in Chapter 8. &nbsp;Please read sections 8.1-8.4. &nbsp;</p>

<h2>Historical Perspective</h2>

<p>Enthusiasm for the possibility—even certitude—that life exists on Mars has persisted for centuries. Below left is a typical image of Mars obtainable from a ground-based telescope. &nbsp;In the late-1800s, Giovanni Schiaperelli claimed he saw `canals', and in a series of popular books, Percival Lowell (1895-1908) proclaimed that they represented constructions of an advanced civilization dying of thirst. &nbsp;In 1898, author and futurist H. G. Wells wrote a popular novel about an invasion of Earth by technologically advanced Martians. &nbsp;This was recouped in 1938 in a radio drama by Orson Welles that caused widespread panic. &nbsp;It was not until NASA's robotic flybys (1960s) and landers (Viking missions, 1970s) that is was completely established that no large forms of life is present on Mars; &nbsp;thousands of pictures have been returned from the Martian surface, and no Martian animals, plants, footprints or other indications of large life forms is seen. The controversy today is whether there is microbial life, or fossils of past life from an era when the climate was warmer and liquid water was prevalent.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: left; ">Evidence for Liquid Water in Mars' Past</h2>

<p>In our class on&nbsp;<em>The terrestrial planets</em> in our&nbsp;<em>Review of our Solar System</em>, we described many surface features of Mars indicating liquid water was present in the past: &nbsp;streambeds flowing from overfilled craters; craters surrounded by mud flows; dry meandering riverbeds; lake shorelines; gullies around the Valle Marineris canyon system; scarps (cliffs) around the base of Mons Olympus. &nbsp;Recent rovers making close-up studies of the Martian landscape found ripple patterns in rock; sedimentary layers of rock; carbonates (like limestone) and ball-shaped hematite minerals that can only form under water. &nbsp;</p>

<p>If water once flowed on Mars, the temperature of its surface and atmosphere must have been considerably warmer than it is today. &nbsp;This is likely due to an increased greenhouse effect from more carbon dioxide and other gases (water? methane? sulfur dioxide? nitrous oxide?) in the past. &nbsp;Several causes for the gradual loss of warming atmosphere may be involved: &nbsp;the ablation (stripping away) of Mars' atmosphere by the Sun's wind; the destruction of water (H<sub>2</sub>O) by the Sun's ultraviolet radiation and subsequent loss of hydrogen to space; ejection due to the explosions from large asteroid impacts; the end of active volcanism as the planet cooled and crust thickened; changes in the planet's obliquity (axis of rotation). &nbsp;See LUBS sec 8.3 for discussion of these possibilities, but our understanding of Mars' ancient climate is still quite uncertain and is actively studied today. &nbsp;</p>

<h2>Evidence for Life of Mars</h2>

<p>We really have no evidence for life on Mars. &nbsp;No Martian bunny has been photographed on the surface of the planet. &nbsp;While sedimentary rocks have been seen, no fossils of ancient life have yet been photographed. &nbsp;No messages or visits from Martian civilizations have been identified (outside of fictional stories). &nbsp;But with the clear knowledge that liquid water once flowed profusely on Mars, and the presence of carbon dioxide gas in the atmosphere and carbonate minerals in the rock indicating that organic (carbon-based) molecules were present, and of course the presence of sunlight as an energy source, we satisfy the basic conditions for the emergence of living organisms discussed in our last lesson (<em>General Considerations</em>). &nbsp;There is, thus, intense interest today in establishing whether life once was present on Mars.</p>

<p>In the late-1970s, NASA launched two excellent probes that landed softly on Mars (although, unlike more recent probes, they did not have wheels and the ability to move) and provided our first close-up view of the Martian surface. &nbsp;These Viking landers had a robotic shovel that scooped up soil and placed in into three small laboratories specifically designed to search for active life forms (see LUBS p. 281-2). &nbsp;The results were tantalizing! &nbsp;When Martian soil is placed into water, it fizzes, absorbing carbon dioxide and releasing oxygen just like green plants on Earth. &nbsp;However, a mass spectrometer experiment revealed no organic molecules at all. &nbsp;These apparently contradictory results have been explained as the consequence of the Sun's ultraviolet light irradiating the soil giving rise to suboxide or peroxide minerals. &nbsp;When placed in water, these materials can absorb carbon dioxide and emit oxygen ... but without any metabolism of living organisms (analogous to the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxjb2UJZ-5I" style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; ">fizzing</a>&nbsp;of a common treatment for stomach distress). &nbsp;See more details from the <a href="http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/O/OyamaHypoth.html">Encyclopedia of Science website</a>.</p>

<p>There is one other curiosity. &nbsp;Telescopes in Hawaii have taken infrared spectra of the Martian atmosphere for many years. &nbsp;In 2003, <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/mars/news/marsmethane.html">methane</a> was seen over localized regions of the northern hemisphere during its summer. &nbsp;Methane on Mars should be rapidly (few years) destroyed by solar ultraviolet ... so where did it come from? Is it from the ancient atmosphere, trapped in the rock for billions of years and suddenly released? &nbsp;Or, as on Earth, is the methane generated by microbial life? &nbsp;This puzzle has not been solved. &nbsp;A new probe by NASA, the <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/msl">Mars Science Lander</a> (nicknamed Curiosity), is on its way to Mars and should land in August 2012. &nbsp; It has a variety of advanced experiments specifically to look for microbial life. &nbsp;</p>
