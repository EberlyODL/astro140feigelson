<p><em>Having established a reasonable model for how our Solar System emerged from its protoplanetary disk, we now see what changes are needed for exoplanetary systems. &nbsp;Two topics are nicely understood: the origin of `hot Jupiters', and the origin of `eccentric Jupiters'. &nbsp;</em><em>&nbsp;The hot Jupiter issue is discussed in more detail in our text, An Introduction to Astrobiology, Chpt. 7.3. &nbsp;</em><em>Other issues are still under study and debate; for example, of all the gas giants undergo inward migration, then there should not be any terrestrial planets in the Habitable Zones!&nbsp;</em></p>

But we have found that many of the exoplanetary systems discovered in Doppler (radial velocity) searches have Jupiters in high-eccentricity, inclined orbits. Fortunately, astrophysicists quickly found a convincing explanation for these eccentric Jupiters.&nbsp;</p>

Unstable orbital interactions can easily lead to a cataclysmic realignment of the planets' orbits. From simulations of such systems, theorists find that a frequent outcome is for one of the gas giants to collide with the host star or be ejected from the planetary system; at the same time, the remaining gas giant acquires a high-eccentricity orbit. As most of the planetary systems found so far with Doppler searches have eccentric Jupiter-mass planets, this appears to be a common occurrence, with a relatively small minority of planetary systems having their Jupiters in nearly-circular orbits as in our Solar System.&nbsp;</p>

Specifically, the gravitational interaction of two gas giant planets - for example, our Jupiter and Saturn - can act to halt or even reverse the inward migration of the inner planet (Jupiter, in our case), holding it in place until the protoplanetary disk has dissipated, and all of the protoplanetary objects are either ejected from the system, or incorporated into a planet. Once the disk is dissipated, the forces of planetary migration stop, and planetary orbits are generally stable for the very long term (> Ga).&nbsp;</p>

So planetary systems with hot Jupiters are unlikely to host habitable terrestrial planets.

As this movie progresses also watch the water shown in blue; water from icy planetisimals can impact the inner planets giving oceans on rocky planets near the Habitable Zone. It is still not clear why some Jupiters spiral in while others don't, and under what conditions inner rocky planets can survive.&nbsp;</p>
