<h2>Conditions for Life Arising on Planets and Moons</h2>
<h3>Liquid Oceans or Ponds</h3>
<p>A liquid is needed as solvent for speeding up chemical reactions which are slow in gases (and extremely slow in solids). The most promising molecule is water (H<sub>2</sub>O) &nbsp;Water has nice advantages: solvent for many materials (that is, many chemicals dissolve in water); wide range of liquid phase (between its freezing temperature 0<sup>o</sup>C and boiling temperature 100<sup>o</sup>C); has a polar structure (a property of liquid water that promotes chemical reactions); and its solid phase (ice) floats on its liquid phas (water). But there are other possible solvents where life conceivably might form including ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub>), methane (CH<sub>4</sub>) or other hydrocarbons. &nbsp;</p>
<h3>Organic Molecules</h3>
<p>These are carbon-based (C) molecules with hydrogen (H), oxygen (O) and nitrogen (N). Terrestrial biological molecules also use small quantities of ~21 other elements: phosphorus (P) in DNA, calcium (Ca) in bones/teeth, iron (Fe) in blood, etc. Living organisms based on non-carbon molecules seems doubtful. For example, silicon (Si) has the same valence as carbon (4 free electrons), but polymers based on silicon tends to be solid crystals (rock) rather than chains and rings. &nbsp;</p>
<h3>Energy</h3>
<p>A source of energy to drive chemical reactions is needed. For terrestrial life today, the principal energy source is sunlight that, through photosynthetic plants with chlorophyll, can produce organic molecules like sugars from simple atmospheric molecules like water and carbon dioxide. &nbsp;But some terrestrial life forms (mostly archaea bacteria or extremophiles) get energy from sulfur, hydrogen or methane in unusual locations such as deep sea vents. &nbsp;</p>
<h2>Life in the Solar System? &nbsp;</h2>
<p>From these general conditions for a habitable planet or moon, we can see why Earth is a great place for life to arise and thrive. Its orbit is perfectly placed in the&nbsp;<strong>habitable zone</strong> where water is mostly liquid (oceans, lakes, rain). &nbsp;As we learned last week, the early Earth had lots of carbon in its atmosphere in the form of carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) which became available for living organisms.</p>
<p>Sunlight on Earth is bright as a source of energy, but not too strong to destroy complex organic molecules. &nbsp;Basically, Earth is a great place for life!!</p>
<p>But, based on the conditions above, we can pretty much exclude some locations in the Solar System as habitable environments: &nbsp;</p>

<p></p>
<ul><li>The planet <strong>Mercury</strong> and our <strong>Moon</strong> are small with gravity too weak to hold on to any gaseous or liquid atmosphere. &nbsp;There are no organic (C-based) molecules or oceans on Mercury or Moon, just a rocky surface. &nbsp;</li></ul>
<p style="text-align: center; "><a href="/_legacy/astro140/07_08_figure.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="The surface of Venus photographed by the Soviet Venera space probe" class="lightbox" src="/_legacy/astro140/07_08_figure.jpg" style="width: 30%;"></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="/_legacy/astro140/jupiter_cassini.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="Jupiter's atmosphere photographed by the ESA/NASA Cassini space probe" class="lightbox" src="/_legacy/astro140/jupiter_cassini.jpg" style="width: 30%;"></a></p>
<ul><li><strong>Venus</strong> can also be excluded as a possible site for life because its surface is so hot due to the runaway greenhouse effect from its dense CO<sub>2</sub> atmosphere. &nbsp;All water boiled away billions of years ago, and any organic molecules on Venus would quickly be destroyed by the heat.</li><li>The&nbsp;<strong>Jovian planets</strong><strong>—</strong>Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune<strong>—</strong>are unlikely site for the emergence of living organisms because their&nbsp;cores are buried under enormously dense atmospheres of hydrogen or methane. &nbsp; There are carbon-rich molecules, so it is conceivable that (from&nbsp;gas chemistry rather than water-based liquid chemistry) self-reproducing organisms arose in the swirling Jovian atmospheres, but this seems doubtful.</li></ul>

<ul><li><strong>Comets,&nbsp;</strong>which spend most of their lives far from the Sun beyond the Kuiper Belt, might seem to be inhospitable to life due to the cold temperatures and lack of energy source. &nbsp;But they do have two important ingredients: &nbsp;water (comets are mostly made of water ice) and organic molecules. &nbsp;When it was imaged by spacecraft during its 1986 approach to the Sun, the nucleus of Comet Halley was `black as velvet', probably covered with some carbon material like soot or coal. &nbsp;While not harboring life forms themselves, comets may have been important in helping life arise on the early Earth. &nbsp;Many likely impacted Earth, giving it water for its oceans and simple organic molecules for early living organisms. &nbsp;</li></ul>

Trace amino acids and other organic molecules are found in the dark matrix" class="lightbox" src="/_legacy/astro140/murchison_crop.jpg" style="width: 30%;"></a></p>
<ul><li>Some <b>asteroids</b> in the Asteroid Belt are also very interesting with respect to life. &nbsp;The most primitive meteorites which come from a class of asteroids in the Asteroid Belt are called&nbsp;<strong>carbonaceous chondrites. &nbsp;</strong>These have rocky chondrules surrounded by a dark carbon-rich matrix similar to coal. &nbsp;In this matrix, dozens of different amino acids and other organic molecules have been found in trace amounts. &nbsp;These molecules are "racemic" (equal quantities of right- and left-handed molecules), while amino acids in living organisms on Earth are all left-handed.&nbsp; This shows they are definitely not due to contamination after they landed on Earth, but were formed in the interstellar medium or the early solar nebula. &nbsp; As with comets, it is likely that the impacts of many asteroids on the early Earth provided water and organic materials that could be valuable for the origin of life on Earth</li></ul>
<p>It thus seems that, aside from Earth, most of the Solar System seems inhospitable to life.&nbsp;&nbsp;But, in recent decades, interest by scientists has concentrated on the possibility of life in two specific Solar System environments:&nbsp; The surface of Mars, and the surface or interiors of some Jovian moons.</p>
<p>We now proceed to investigate these possibilities.</p>
