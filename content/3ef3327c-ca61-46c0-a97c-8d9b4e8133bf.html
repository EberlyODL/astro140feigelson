<p>Recall after our Drake equation discussion that the distance to the body-of-interest in the Galaxy is</p>
<center><p>d = (2x10<sup>13</sup>/N)<sup>1/3</sup> parsecs,</p></center>
<p>where N is the number of bodies-of-interest. &nbsp;If&nbsp;we were interested in advanced communicable civilizations, and we had chosen inputs to&nbsp;the Drake Equation that resulted in an&nbsp;estimate of N~10<sup>4</sup>, then N is a relative small number by astronomical standards. &nbsp;But if we are interested in visiting any nearby habitable planet, N~10<sup>9</sup>, a much bigger number.</p>
<p>Let's assume here an intermediate value of N~10<sup>6</sup>. &nbsp;Then the equation above tells us that the nearest habitable planet is at a distance of d = 30 parsecs ~ 100 lightyears ~ 1x10<sup>18</sup>&nbsp;meters.&nbsp; Our current spacecraft (e.g. Space Shuttle, planetary probes) travel at a speed around v = 10<sup>4</sup> m/s, so the travel time would be</p>
<center><p>t = d/v = 1x10<sup>18</sup>&nbsp;m / 10<sup>4</sup> m/s = 1x10<sup>14</sup>&nbsp;sec ~ 3 million years.&nbsp;</p></center>
<p>This roughly the age of hominids ... human-like primates roved the savannahs of Africa 3 million years ago. &nbsp;This is far too long for a convenient visit to a new planet!</p>
<p>The obvious solution is to develop rocket propulsions that give faster speeds, say v = 0.1 c = 3x10<sup>7</sup> m/s.&nbsp;&nbsp; Now the travel time would be</p>
<center><p>t = 1x10<sup>18</sup>&nbsp;m / 3x10<sup>7</sup> m/s = 3x10<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;s = 1 thousand years,</p></center>
<p>which is still very long but not inconceivable.</p>
<p>Let's check whether the human body can tolerate the acceleration and deceleration up to these speeds.&nbsp; A spacecraft acceleration equivalent to the gravitational acceleration we feel on Earth's surface would be a ~ v/t ~ 10 m/s<sup>2</sup>.&nbsp; To reach a speed of v=0.1c would take</p>
<center><p>t ~ v / a = 3x10<sup>7</sup> m/s / 10 m/s<sup>2</sup> = 1 month,</p></center>
<p>which is no problem.</p>
<p>Now let's check the power requirements.&nbsp; Assume the spacecraft has a mass of 100 tons, equivalent to a dozen trucks.&nbsp; Its kinetic energy is</p>
<center><p>E = 1/2 m v<sup>2</sup> = 1/2 (1x10<sup>5</sup> kg) (3x10<sup>7</sup> m/s)<sup>2</sup> = 5x10<sup>19</sup> watt-sec.</p></center>
<p>The engine power must thus be at least</p>
<center><p>E / t = 5x10<sup>19</sup> watt-s / 3x10<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;s ~ 2000 megawatts,</p></center>
<p>comparable to a big modern power station that generates electricity for a major city.&nbsp; (Here I've assumed acceleration throughout the thousand-year trip.) This doesn't seem too difficult ... we obviously know how to build a power station. But how do we fit the power station into a small spacecraft and, more importantly, how do we fit all of its fuel supply into this small volume. Coal, petroleum, even uranium to power the plant for a thousand years cannot fit.</p>
<p>The only choice is to use the most efficient source of energy known, one that directly taps Einstein's equivalence of mass and energy, E=mc<sup>2</sup>.&nbsp; For such a fuel, we only need a small mass:</p>
<center><p>m = E / c<sup>2</sup> ~ 5x10<sup>19</sup> watt-s / (3x10<sup>8</sup> m/s)<sup>2</sup> = 500 kg,</p></center>
<p>which is within the mass budget for our interstellar spaceship.</p>
<p>So we can, in principle, build and power an interstellar space ship that will take (only!) a thousand years to reach the nearest habitable planet. &nbsp;But the only efficient way we know to derive this energy is from the annihilation of matter and anti-matter, and we have not been able to make and transport more than infinitisimal quantities of anti-matter. The giant particle accelerator at Fermilab's Main Injector (underground near Chicago) can accumulate ~10<sup>-8</sup> grams of antiprotons/year. If Fermilab uses ~10<sup>-4</sup> of modern society's energy resources, it would take 10<sup>9</sup> years to collect the fuel our spaceship. This is reduced to ~10<sup>5</sup> years if one could tap all of the solar energy incident on the Earth's surface, and less if one could build a Ringworld or a Dyson sphere to trap a greater fraction of their Sun's energy output. The antiprotons produced must then be cooled with electrons in magnetic traps and (perhaps) stored as solid antihydrogen until needed for flight propulsion. See the analysis <a href="http://www.engr.psu.edu/antimatter/Papers/anti_prod.pdf" target="_blank">Production and trapping of antimatter for space propulsion applications</a> by (former-PSU Physics professor) G. A. Smith & colleagues.</p>
<p>We thus find that it is totally impractical to fuel an interstellar spaceship, even though it is not physically impossible to build it. &nbsp;Arguments have been made to mitigate this problem; for instance, build a `ramjet' that collects protons (or even some antiprotons) from the interstellar medium as the space ship travels forward. &nbsp;But designs have always encountered enormous practical barriers. &nbsp;Another possibility is to build a "sail" that is propelled by reflecting light. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Indeed, in 2016&nbsp;a team announced a <a href="https://breakthroughinitiatives.org/Initiative/3" target="_blank">new interstellar&nbsp;travel project</a> within the goal of sending tiny probes ("gram scale")&nbsp;to Alpha Centauri using a lightsail and arrays of antennas transmitting gigawatt-hours of energy to accelerate them to roughly a 1/6 the speed light. &nbsp;The project leaders&nbsp;deem this to&nbsp;feasible with realistic technological improvements within a few decades. The initial effort is funded by a Silicon Valley billionaire, and advisory council includes distinguished astrophysicists. See the New York Times article <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/13/science/alpha-centauri-breakthrough-starshot-yuri-milner-stephen-hawking.html" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p><big><b>Conclusion: </b></big></p>
<p><big>The distances between existing intelligent civilizations is likely to be >1000 light years, but the distances to neraby habitable planets may only be ~100 lightyears. &nbsp;It is physically possible for a civilization&nbsp; to travel such distances if the travel time is long (say 10<sup>3</sup> yrs).&nbsp; Is very difficult, but it is not physically impossible. </big>While we cannot build a functioning interstellar space ship today, we know that, at lesat in principle, it is not impossible. Perhaps a more advance civilization, or perhaps in ourselves in the far future, can build one. &nbsp;</p>
<p>If we were to focus&nbsp;on very small probes and the very closest stars, then&nbsp;it's not inconceivable that humans could send very small satellites to some of the nearest stars within our life times. &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p>
