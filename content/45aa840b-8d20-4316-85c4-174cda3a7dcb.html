<p>The table below summarizes the key deadlines for the papers and class project, as well as the date ranges (Eastern Time) when you will be required to take each of the five quizzes. &nbsp;I strongly recommend that students start papers and projects well in advance, so as to smooth out the time required to do a good job. &nbsp;While course grades will be based on discussion posts as of Dec 12, they will be much more valuable to students who participate in each week's discussion. &nbsp;Similarly, I recommend that students&nbsp;keep up with each week's readings from the textbook and course content website, rather than trying to cram many readings into&nbsp;a small period of time. &nbsp;
