<p>We have seen that, in a spiral galaxy like the Milky Way, a complicated "interstellar medium" resides in the space between stars. It consists of gases (mostly hydrogen and helium from the Big Bang, with a soup of interesting molecules) and tiny solid "dust grains" (some made of rock like tiny sand grains, others made of carbon like soot). &nbsp;We see it best in illuminated clouds like in the <a href="https://media.ed.science.psu.edu/content/orion-nebula">Orion Nebula</a> or&nbsp;<a href="http://media.ed.science.psu.edu/content/eagle-nebula-cloud">Eagle Nebula</a>. &nbsp;As a spiral arm passes through a region in the Galaxy, the interstellar material is compressed and dark cold clouds form. When a cloud of interstellar medium is dense enough, gravity locally dominates other forces and a star forms by `gravitational collapse'. Material with too much spin forms a flattened disk orbiting the protostar; this is the "protoplanetary disk" where planets form. The star and disk formation process is complicated, and astrophysical modeling is underway. Thus stars, planets, and any life on these planets inherit their molecules from the interstellar medium.</p>

<p>In Bate's simulations, the gas in the cloud starts off with random swirling motions known as <strong>turbulence</strong>. Then some clumps undergo gravitational collapse forming stars (white dots), but gas in filaments continue to fall into central concentrations of gas. Some stars form in isolation with their disks, but many interact with other young stars and disks in complex ways. A large fraction of stars remain in binary systems. Many stars form in large molecular clouds where hundreds or thousands of stars form together as a <a href="http://www.astro.ex.ac.uk/people/mbate/Cluster/Animations/ClusterXT1810Z_H264B_s.mov" target="_blank">star cluster</a>. Here, too, individual stars often have these&nbsp;<strong>protoplanetary disks</strong>. We will study protoplanetary disks later in the course to understand how diverse types of planetary systems form; this is needed to evaluate how many planets could harbor life similar to Earth's.</p>
<p>The central points are that</p>
<ul><li>stars form by gravitational collapse in molecular clouds which pervade the thin disk of the Galaxy; and</li><li>due to the turbulence in the clouds, disks of interstellar gas and dust orbit the protostars, and these protoplanetary disks are the site of planet formation. &nbsp;</li></ul>
