Prior to the fly-by missions of the Voyager probes in the 1980s, there was little expectation of liquids needed for life anywhere in the Solar System beyond Mars. The reason is simply temperature: the Sun's light is so faint at these distances that no body's surface can reach the melting temperature of water. &nbsp;Scientists expected that the moons would either be rocky like the asteroids, or icy with ancient frozen surfaces, showing only craters from many asteroid impacts. &nbsp;Jupiter's biggest moon, Callisto (shown below), is a good example of this, as well as many smaller Jovian moons. &nbsp;<p style="text-align: center; "><a href="/_legacy/astro140/09_19_figure.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="Jupiter's moon Callisto showing an old, heavily cratered icy surface" class="lightbox" src="https://courses.ed.science.psu.edu/_legacy/astro140/09_19_figure.jpg" style="width: 400px; height: 454px;"></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left; ">It was thus a big surprise when Voyager found several moons with young, active surfaces, showing few impact craters. Understanding these moons was a major motivation for the complex and expensive missions of the 2000s: the NASA's Galileo probe, which orbited within Jupiter's system, and European Space Agency's (ESA's) Cassini mission that is still orbiting within Saturn's system. &nbsp;Jupiter's innermost moon, Io (not shown here, see LUBS Fig 9.9), nearly entirely melted by tidal stresses, has many active volcanoes that perpetually cover the surface with new material. &nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left; ">But it was Jupiter's moon Europa (and similarly, Ganymede) that seemed most relevant to the search for life in the Solar System. It has a water ice surface like Callisto, but very few craters. &nbsp;The surface must have been melted and refrozen. &nbsp;The strange grooves, rough patches, and&nbsp;multicolored ice suggest that this melting is a recurrent process, not from a single violent event. Study the pictures below. &nbsp;Dark ice fills some grooves and patches on the surface. &nbsp;This suggests that the ice covering is not very thick, and liquid (or slushy) water lies below and wells up when the surface cracks. &nbsp;The rough patches on the surface (chaotic terrain) may be the product of ice plates grinding against each other, similar to mountain-building on Earth due to plate tectonics.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: center; "><a href="/_legacy/astro140/europa_ridges.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="Close-up photos of Europa's surface and a model for the formation of these small ridges" class="lightbox" src="https://courses.ed.science.psu.edu/_legacy/astro140/europa_ridges.jpg" style="cursor: default; border-width: 0px; width: 80%;"></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left; ">This requires that Europa have a liquid water layer beneath a relatively thin ice crust. &nbsp;This is supported by the presence of a weak magnetic field around Europa. &nbsp;What keeps it above freezing temperature? &nbsp;Perhaps it is tidal forces (weaker than Io's) due to its slightly elliptical orbit and perturbations by other moons. &nbsp;Perhaps large impacts episodically melt the interior. &nbsp;The thickness of the ice crust and the water ocean is quite uncertain; below are two models for Europa's interior. &nbsp;NASA engineers and scientists have conceptually designed a mission that would land on Europa with a probe that would melt its way through the ice and swim in the hidden ocean. &nbsp;But this <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPCpNlVJBr8" target="_blank">ice-penetrating robot mission</a> has not been approved by NASA or Congress.</p>

<p style="text-align: left; ">Jupiter's moon Europa is not the only one that appears to have melted interior. &nbsp;Neptune's moon Triton is bizarre, half covered with an ancient cratered surface and have with a smooth uncratered surface. &nbsp;Perhaps it collided with another moon and partially melted. &nbsp;Saturn's moon Enceladus shows some craters, but also has discolorations and grooves. &nbsp;Here the Cassini probe has photographed geysers (essentially water volcanoes) along a long ridge. &nbsp;As with Europa, this can be explained only if the surface ice is relatively thin and a (partially) melted layer lies below. &nbsp;Here are some photos of Enceladus.</p>

<p style="text-align: left; ">We finally come to Saturn's moon Titan, the largest in the Solar System. &nbsp;It was already known from ground-based studies that it is the only moon with its own atmosphere, mostly nitrogen (N<sub>2</sub>) with some methane (CH<sub>4</sub>). &nbsp;The surface cannot be seen in visible light due to the thick clouds, but Cassini has obtained detailed maps of the surface in infrared light and radar reflectance. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center; "><a href="/_legacy/astro140/titan_cassini.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="Titan seen in visible light by the Cassini mission" class="lightbox" src="https://courses.ed.science.psu.edu/_legacy/astro140/titan_cassini.jpg" style="width: 40%;"></a>&nbsp;<a href="/_legacy/astro140/titan_fulldisk_cassini.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="Full disk of Saturn's moon Titan showing the surface in infrared light, photographed by the Cassini probe" class="lightbox" src="https://courses.ed.science.psu.edu/_legacy/astro140/titan_fulldisk_cassini.jpg" style="width: 50%;"></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left; ">The remarkable Cassini mission has a separate probe names Huyghens that was launched into Titan's atmosphere, descending slowly with parachutes, and landing softly. &nbsp;The results were amazing! &nbsp;The photos during the descent showed a complicated system of streams flowing into lakes. &nbsp;The landing was squishy, onto a marshy surface. &nbsp;The `rocks' on the surface (probably water ice) seemed embedded in a muddy material. &nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left; ">What is the liquid on Titan? &nbsp;It is much too cold for liquid water, and the atmosphere does not show water vapor. &nbsp;The liquid seems to be a hydrocarbon: methane, perhaps combined with ethane (C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>). &nbsp;On Earth, this is called LNG, liquified natural gas, and is used as a fuel. &nbsp;Titan seems to have a full climate with polar methane ice caps, methane clouds and rainstorms, rivers and lakes. &nbsp;Cassini has traced a seasonal cycle involving warming with lake evaporation, and cooling with expanding ice caps. &nbsp;Models of Titan's interior suggest that another liquid layer may be present, this time liquid ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub>).&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center; "><a href="/_legacy/astro140/titan_descent.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="Photo of methane streams on Titan, photographed by Cassini's Huyghens probe as it parachuted to the surface" src="https://courses.ed.science.psu.edu/_legacy/astro140/titan_descent.jpg" style="width: 40%;"></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="/_legacy/astro140/titan_surface.png" target="_blank"><img alt="A photo from the surface of Titan showing rocks in a `muddy' soil (the liquid is probably methane)" class="lightbox" src="https://courses.ed.science.psu.edu/_legacy/astro140/titan_surface.png" style="width: 30%;"></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left; ">One can only speculate whether life can arise on Titan's surface where the temperature is around 90<sup>o</sup> K. &nbsp;Recent laboratory experiments (similar to the Miller-Urey experiments for early Earth) indicate that amino acids and nucleic acids, critical components of proteins and DNA, could form if the temperature were hotter. &nbsp;Astronomers note that, in a few billion years, the Sun will become a red giant star, boiling water on Earth but warming Titan to more habitable temperatures. &nbsp;Altogether, after Earth, Titan seems to have the best chance for life in the Solar System with a solid surface, carbon-rich chemistry, a liquid solvent, and ecological variety. &nbsp;Last year, NASA approved funds for preliminary study of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titan_Mare_Explorer" target="_blank">Titan Mare Explorer</a> that would splash-land in one of its methane lakes and study its chemistry. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>We thus find that, contrary to any reasonable expectation before detailed study with robotic probes, that some Jovian moons have liquid on (or close to) their surfaces. &nbsp;Europa and similar moons have water oceans below their ice coverings, and Titan has incredible liquid hydrocarbon lakes on its surface.</p>
<p>It is likely that, in coming decades, humans will send more probes to the moons to study them ... and look for primitive live forms.&nbsp;</p>
