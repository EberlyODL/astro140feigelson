<div class="art-postcontent"><div class="art-article"><p>We first lay the foundations of Life in the Universe by discussing the Universe as a whole, its origins in a Big Bang ~14&nbsp;billion years ago, and its history until the present day. Big Bang cosmology began in the early-20th century, was largely confirmed by the late-20th century, and is now in an era of detailed investigation, establishing the parameters of the model to ~1% precision. &nbsp;Modern cosmology is full of unexpected and unintuitive features: a universal expansion (similar to blowing up a balloon); its contents dominated by mysterious Dark Matter and Dark Energy; a clear explanation for the formation of the simplest elements (hydrogen and helium), and the formation of stars and galaxies.</p>
<p>We then proceed to discuss galaxies that form from the matter in the expanding Universe, and our Milky Way Galaxy in particular. &nbsp;It has billions of stars, but also an `interstellar medium' of gas and solid particles from which later stars and planets form. &nbsp;So this lays the astronomical foundations for the existence of planets and chemical ingredients needed for life. &nbsp;</p>
<p>All societies have a cosmology â€¦ an explanation for the origin and development of the world around us. In many traditional cultures, the world is created by deities, gods and goddesses. The previous lecture outlined the rise of modern science, starting with Isaac Newton's mathematical relationships defining the motions and gravitational interactions of physical objects. &nbsp;So our cosmology is based on modern scientific theories (gravity, atomic & molecular physics, etc) that has been completely validated in the laboratory and in technologies. &nbsp;This is the first cosmology that is `true' in an empirical sense, not based on beliefs or speculations. &nbsp;</p></div></div>
