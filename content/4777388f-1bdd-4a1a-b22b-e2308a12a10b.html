<p>Week&nbsp;3&nbsp;treats the chemical foundations, origin and evolution of living organisms on Earth. Our coverage is necessarily brief...these are huge fields of biochemistry, cell biology, and evolutionary biology. But our text&nbsp;<em>An Introduction to Astrobiology&nbsp;</em>has an excellent Chapter 1 that presents much of the needed material in a compact, but well-written fashion. &nbsp;The&nbsp;lectures in the following pages&nbsp;below emphasize some of the text's topics and introduces a few new ideas. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Week 4 proceeds with some topics on terrestrial life. &nbsp;Perhaps the most important topic&nbsp;is the interactions between dominant living organisms and the planet's atmosphere: consumption of carbon dioxide and production of oxygen by micro-organisms and plants with&nbsp;photosynthesis; and the recent reintroduction of carbon dioxide by a particular advanced animal ... us! &nbsp;Thus the issue of `global warming' that is widely discussed in modern society is but a single example of various ways life can affect their host planet. &nbsp;</p>
