<p>If N<sub>i</sub>&nbsp;(minus one, ourselves) intelligences exist in the Galaxy at a typical distance of hundreds (optimistic N<sub>i</sub>) to tens-of-thousands (pessimistic N<sub>i</sub>) light years distance, how do we best communicate with them? &nbsp;On Earth, advanced organisms communicate by sound waves that travel through air or water. &nbsp;But in interstellar space, such waves are difficult to produce and travel slowly. &nbsp;It is best to use light waves that travel at c=300,000 kilometers/second. &nbsp;Physics tells us that nothing can travel faster than light! &nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<h3>What waveband should we use?</h3>
<p>Let us recall the types of light we can produce and detect, the electromagnetic spectrum:</p>
<center><p><img alt="" src="/_legacy/astro140/spectrum.jpg" style="width: 500px; height: 263px; "></p></center>
<p>Sixty years ago, scientists like Frank Drake, Phil Morrison, and Josef Schlovsky asked: &nbsp;Which wavebands of light are best for communicating across our Galactic disk?</p>
<ul><li><b>Hard X-rays/gamma-rays</b>: Hard to produce, impossible to focus</li><li><b>Ultraviolet/soft X-rays</b>: Absorbed by atoms in interstellar gas (and Earth's atmosphere)</li><li><b>Optical</b>: Signals overwhelmed by starlight (unless pulsed rapidly)</li><li><b>Infrared</b>: Overwhelmed by interstellar & interplanetary dust emission (and Earth's atmosphere)</li><li><b>Microwave</b>: Overwhelmed by the cosmic microwave background radiation from the Big Bang that formed the Universe</li><li><b>Centimeter-wavelength (1-30 GHz) radio</b>: YES! No problem!!</li><li><b>Longer than meter wavelength</b>: Overwhelmed by interstellar electron synchrotron emission</li><li><b>Non-electromagnetic radiation</b>: neutrino beams? neutron beams? other subatomic particles? Technologies ineffective or not available to us yet.</li></ul>
<p>So it seems that radio wavelengths are best for interstellar communication. &nbsp;Large radio telescopes sensitive to centimeter wavelength light are easily constructed (e.g. Arecibo Telescope in Puerto Rico, Very Large Array in New Mexico - photos below), radio waves are easily focused (paraboloid shaped dishes), radio receivers are extremely sensitive for reception, and radio broadcasting is easy (e.g. TV stations, radar at airports). Existing radio telescopes could easily detect a typical terrestrial radio/TV broadcast across the Galaxy -- if it were beamed directly towards us.</p>

<p></p>
<h3>What frequency should we use?&nbsp;</h3>
<div>Examples: AM band from 0.5-1.6 MHz; FM from 88-108 MHz; TV scattered from 50-1000 MHz, plus police/taxi radios, airport/military radar, satellite communications, etc. Only a few narrow bands are kept quiet for radio astronomy. &nbsp;Arguments have been made that the best frequency to use is around 1420 MHz (21.1 cm), the emission line of cold hydrogen. &nbsp;</div>
<div></div>
<div>But the best answer is: "We can not know what frequencies the alien civilizations will use to listen or broadcast their signals". &nbsp;So we build&nbsp;build receivers that analyze signals from many (million, billion!) channels simultaneously within broad radio astronomical bands.&nbsp;</div>
<div></div>
<h3>How do we recognize an alien signal?&nbsp;</h3>
<div>Criteria might include: narrow band signal at wavelength not produced by atoms & molecules; rapid variations in signal intensity (a message!) but not a radio pulsar; signal seen from star with good lifezone for habitable planets: signal seen in different telescopes (not local interference); periodic intensity or Doppler shifts from from their planet's rotation/orbit; signal contains complex information.&nbsp;</div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<h3>Could Earth be detected by other civilizations?&nbsp;</h3>
<div>Major emission in centimeter band are military radar (esp. over Alaska and Siberia) and TV stations (esp. over US and Europe). See our text's Figure 9.6 for the daily variation expected in some radio band as the Earth rotates and various radio transmitters rise and set. The Arecibo Telescope could detect these signals out to a few parsecs (tens of stars. Even with our current technology, we could increase sensitivity 100-fold to detect such signals from many thousands of stars. (For example, we could build a large antenna inside a crater on the Moon.) TV broadcasts from 1978 had ~10 million watts power, and are now 20 lightyears (6 pc) away with ~20 A-G-K main sequence stars and hundreds of lower-mass M stars. Now that we know that most stars have planetary systems, and perhaps 1-10% have nearly Earth-size planets in Habitable Zones, it is not impossible that an advanced civilization has already picked up our early radio, television, and radar signals. Indeed, this is the plot of the movie Contact based on the early career of Dr. Jill Tarter, Director of the SETI institute in California. (She is still active, and was a member of the Kepler Science Team.) So the answer to this question is a clear Yes !</div>
<div></div>
<h3>A large SETI project: Project Phoenix&nbsp;</h3>
<div>About 1000 solar-like stars within 50 pc have been targeted with Parkes (Australia) 210-foot, Green Bank (West Virginia) 140-foot, and Arecibo (Puerto Rico) 1000-meter telescopes during the 1990s. ~50 million channels at 1-2 Hz resolution between 1-3 GHz (30-10 cm wavelength) are examined for continuous and pulsed signals, including frequency drifts. &nbsp;Stars with newly discovered planets were included in search. They used private funding because Federal funding was shut off in 1993 by Congress. &nbsp;They would have required confirmation by an independent observatory required for identifying a candidate extreterrestrial signal. &nbsp;The main technical challenge they faced was: elimination of human radio interference. &nbsp;The image below shows frequency (horizontal axis) vs. time (vertical axis) brightness plot with an example of interference.</div>

<div></div>
<div><div>Excerpt from the <a href="http://www.seti-inst.edu/science/phoenix2002.html" target="_blank">Project Phoenix diaries</a>, March 21 2002 at Arecibo (by Seth Shostak, SETI Institute):&nbsp;</div>
<div></div>
<div><em>Jane Jordan and I tried not to get too excited. A signal picked up while observing target 4505, a star very slightly dimmer than the Sun that's 117 light-years away, was persistent and passing all the usual tests. We moved the telescope off the star system, and the signal went away. We ran it back on the target, and the signal reappeared. It was looking good. We continued to examine 4505 until the Earth?s rotation took it beyond Arecibo?s field of view, and it looked good all the while. </em></div>
<div></div>
<div><em>Nonetheless, we've developed a certain &nbsp;resistance to easy adrenaline rushes. &nbsp;The microwave band is increasingly &nbsp;jammed by interference from orbiting &nbsp;satellites, so false alarms are common. &nbsp;As target 4505 drifted out of sight to the west, I wrote in the log book "should be &nbsp;re-observed." The next night, we did exactly that. This time the signal was seen not only in the direction of the star, &nbsp;but in other directions as well. Sadly, it was just more earthly interference, and definitely not extraterrestrial.&nbsp;</em></div>
<div></div>
<div><em>One of these days, this small scenario may end differently. And occasionally we think about that. &nbsp;It's after midnight. Jill Tarter has taken over the observing, so I walk outside the control room to the patio that overlooks the telescope. Overhead, the familiar &nbsp;winter constellations prick the humid air. Is there more out there than simply the &nbsp;frigid blackness of space and the silent boiling of the stars? Are there hidden places where the sounds of life are being made and heard? Do beings exist that &nbsp;can see the universe and understand what they see? It seems impossible to imagine otherwise.</em></div></div>
<p></p>
<h3>Allen Telescope Array&nbsp;</h3>
<div>Initially funded by Paul Allen, founder of Microsoft Corp with Bill Gates, the <a href="http://www.seti.org/ata" target="_blank">Allen Telescope Array</a> of small antennas has been constructed in northern California for full-time SETI search. &nbsp;This increased SETI observations considerably over earlier levels, but the project is suffering from lack of funds. &nbsp;Initially planned to comprise 350 6-member dishes, only 42 have been built. &nbsp; The ATA has four primary advantages for scientific studies over other major radio telescopes: a very wide field-of-view (2.45° at λ = 21cm), complete instantaneous frequency coverage from 0.5 to 11.2 GHz, multiple simultaneous electronic backends, and active interference mitigation. The instantaneous area of sky imaged is 17 times that of the VLA. The instantaneous frequency coverage of more than 4 octaves is unprecedented in radio astronomy.</div>

<div></div>
<div>Despite funding problems, the ATA has been operating for several years and is mostly devoted to SETI searches. &nbsp;It both make shallow scans of large portions of the sky and deeper observations targetted at selected stars. &nbsp;These include stars near the Sun and stars with known exoplanets (e.g. in the Kepler field). &nbsp; &nbsp;</div>
<center><p></p>
<h2><b>The results from all SETI programs over 50 years are clear: &nbsp;</b></h2>
<h2><em><b>No extraterrestrial signals have been detected !! &nbsp;</b></em></h2>
<div><i><strong>Not a single convincing alien signal has emerged from ANY SETI observation to date</strong></i></div></center>
<div></div>
<div>Nonetheless, the search continues and, some would&nbsp;argue that it should be expanded. &nbsp;Jill Tarter gives the following analogy: We have only sampled the stars in the Galaxy to the level of a teaspoon of sea water has sampled the world's oceans. &nbsp;If you don't see a fish in the teaspoon, can you infer that fish don't exist in the ocean? &nbsp;</div>
