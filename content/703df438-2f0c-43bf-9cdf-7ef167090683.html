<p>We want you to enjoy Astro 140 and to do well in it. We do not subscribe to a "weed out" or "pass the bestâ€”flunk the rest" philosophy. By the nature of its content, however, Astro 140 is a course that requires your serious academic commitment. You will not succeed by quickly "skimming" the web pages and book chapters.&nbsp;Even "reading" web pages and textbook is not sufficient for most students. You will need to pause, think about what you read&nbsp;and self-assess how well you understand the content. It's a sign of maturity when you can recognize what aspects of the reading will require more study, such as rereading the material more slowly, seeking out an explanations from alternative sources, or asking questions.&nbsp;At Penn State, a&nbsp;credit represents about&nbsp;40&nbsp;hours of work, so our&nbsp;3-credit course will require about&nbsp;120 hours of your time or&nbsp;8&nbsp;hours-per-week during the&nbsp;15-week semester.</p>
<p>Having no face-to-face classes in a World Campus class has some disadvantages: &nbsp;the students never meet the instructor or each other. &nbsp;But there are advantages.&nbsp; Students need not reside or travel to the Penn State campus; they can live anywhere in the world.&nbsp; Students do not have to attend class at specific times; all interactions are asynchronous.&nbsp; This is very convenient for individuals with other important responsibilities.&nbsp; But the independence provided by World Campus does mean that students must be disciplined in devoting time to the course continuously during the semester.&nbsp; Duties include: studying course material (on-line lectures, linked on-line material, textbook reading), taking timed quizzes (which must be taken within specified Friday-to-Monday intervals), writing two research papers with specified deadlines, participating in interactive discussions and an on-line research activity. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on our collective experience with past students we offer the following suggestions:</p>
<ul><li>Complete all&nbsp;web&nbsp;and textbook reading assignments each week. You are encouraged also to click on other web links and readings; they have been&nbsp;selected&nbsp;to give&nbsp;a richer background on the issues while avoiding overwhelming detail.&nbsp;</li><li>Professor Ford&nbsp;is available to answer questions, whether you are working ot better understand the material or eager to learn more about some aspect of the course. &nbsp;Email him at <a href="mailto:eford@psu.edu?subject=ASTRO%20140%3A%20">eford@psu.edu</a> with "ASTRO 140" in the subject line.&nbsp;</li><li>We&nbsp;suggest you schedule your study time to allow a few large blocks of time for studying material of this course each week. &nbsp;Practicing your ability&nbsp;to work intensively for an extended period of time is&nbsp;a skill that will help you in the midterm and final&nbsp;exams, and also more generally in other classes and your work beyond Penn State.&nbsp;</li><li>The standards for the&nbsp;course quizzes, papers and project&nbsp;will be clear; in particular, written standards for the course&nbsp;papers&nbsp;will be high. &nbsp;We will provide specific guidance on how to write a science essay. &nbsp;It is important to realize that this is quite different from other forms of writing such as persuasive or creative writing. Even if you are already well-versed in some forms of writing, you should expect to work to deveop&nbsp;skill at writing a scientific essay.&nbsp;You are encouraged to interact with Dr. Ford as you research and draft your papers, to focus on clear factual communication and not get overly distracted in details. &nbsp;Writing a strong essay requires time, often significantly more time than one initially thinks. &nbsp;Therefore, please be sure to&nbsp;allow significantly more time than you think you will need to draft and revise your papers.</li><li><strong>Don't fall behind</strong>. Procrastination can quickly lead to a situation from which it may be very difficult to recover. Please, do not wait until the last minute to prepare for exams or write papers. &nbsp;Many students have to work hard to master the material. &nbsp;That takes time. &nbsp;If you do not allow sufficient time, then it may become impractical to do well in the course.</li></ul>
<p>Three study habits that will maximize your chances for success in your online class:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; <strong>Devote sufficient time and effort</strong> <strong>every week</strong>. Time-on-task is a necessary condition for learning. Schedule&nbsp; blocks of time during each week to study the text, to work on assignments, and to read and contribute to discussions / meetings.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; <strong>Approach learning reflectively</strong>. Be aware of your strengths and weakness as a learner, and spend time each week focusing on areas where you want ot improve. Students&nbsp; who are able to relate what they learned to situations outside the classroom (real or virtual) are most likely to retain that knowledge. After each lesson ask yourself questions like, "what did I do well?", "what can I improve?", "how did my work/actions affect the people on my team?</p>
<p>3. <strong>Review and reinforce your learning each week</strong>, looking over the previous week's material, and earlier lessons if appropriate, and connecting it to what you are learning this week. The course outline should help you to place each week's readings in a larger context. &nbsp;</p>
