<h3>Exoplanets: Historical Context</h3>
<p>For most of the history of astronomy, there was only one planetary system known: our Solar System. &nbsp;Despite some past enthusiasms (see the historical overview in the 'Introduction' lecture of Week 1), most astronomers were very pessimistic that planets could be found orbiting other stars by now. The reflected light (in the visible light band) due to Earth is billions of times fainter than the the sun,&nbsp;and the Earth is so close to the Sun that the sunlight dwarfs the faint light reflected by Earth for any alien observers looking at the Sun from a planet orbiting another star. The dynamical effects —&nbsp;pulling and pushing through its gravitational interactions—of an Earth-analog planet on its host star are tiny: typically velocities of less than a meter&nbsp;per second&nbsp;(hundreds of millions times smaller than the speed of light), typical motions less than a thousandth of an arcsecond on the sky. &nbsp;When an Earth-size&nbsp;planet briefly passes in front of a sun-like star, the fraction of the star's surface blocked by the planet is&nbsp;just ~0.01%.</p>
<p>When I was starting out in science, all of these measurements were completely impossible to achieve. &nbsp;Thus, no one had any empirically-based knowledge of whether planetary systems were rare or common, whether our Solar System is typical or extraordinary. And by inference, no one had any empirically-based knowledge about whether planets that could host life. &nbsp;Given the impracticality of detecting planets like those in our solar system,&nbsp;no rational astronomer would devote serious effort to discovering planetary systems. &nbsp;Even the few who did dream of searching for planets, acknowledged that they couldn't justify spending the time, money or telescope time just to search for planets. &nbsp;Instead, they gradually developed the technology to detect low-mass stars and brown dwarfs, in hopes that someday it would be possible to discover planets around other stars. &nbsp;Fortunately, nature produces some planetary systems that are much easier to detect that our own. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The situation completely changed with the discovery of the first exoplanet orbiting the Sun-like star 51 Pegasii in 1995. It was found because the situation was totally unlike our Solar System: A planet with mass greater than Jupiter's was orbiting the star closer than Mercury, not far above the star's surface. This was extraordinary! As "hot Jupiters" were found, astronomers feverishly worked to improve the quality of their spectrographs, their high-resolution cameras, and their photometric cameras ..... vast efforts have been exerted since ~2000 to improve the technologies for planet detection. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The work has been rewarded more richly than even optimists imagined. Only since ~2010, have we had scientific data to conclude that&nbsp;roughly half of the stars we see at night have planetary systems of some sort (and perhaps even more). Most stars with one detectable planet have additional planets. Many are unlike our Solar System, but the data are strongly indicating that a non-trivial fraction of stars have roughly Earth-size or Earth-mass planets in Earth-line orbits.&nbsp;This provides a profound vindication for the optimists about Life in the Universe that we discussed in Week 1 of the class—from Lucretius in ancient Rome, to Bernard de Fontenelle in Renaissance France, to Carl Sagan in 20th century America. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there is much more that we do not know about these planets. &nbsp;In many cases, we know either the planet's size or mass, but not both. &nbsp;We know precious little about their composition,&nbsp;atmospheres, and surfaces. &nbsp;Penn State's Center for Exoplanets and Habitable Worlds includes several faculty designing the next generation of planet hunting instruments and surveys. &nbsp;</p>
<p>We will spend four weeks, Weeks 8-11, studying how the recent discoveries of exoplanets&nbsp;were made, the charcteristics of the planets, and the abundance of known planets. &nbsp;This sets the stage for the final theme of our course, discussion of the potential for&nbsp;life on these exoplanets. This week, Week 8, we will lay the groundwork for the exoplanetary discoveries by discussing methods for finding planets. &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>PLEASE BE CLEAR: &nbsp;ASTRONOMERS HAVE FOUND LOTS OF PLANETS. &nbsp;THEY HAVE NOT FOUND ANY LIFE ON THESE PLANETS.</strong></p>

<h2>Catalogs of Exoplanets</h2>
<p>There are some general resources that you can glance at now, but refer back repeatedly during our study of exoplanets. &nbsp;Take a look at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory's&nbsp;<strong><a href="http://planetquest.jpl.nasa.gov/" style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; " target="_blank">PlanetQuest</a></strong> website which gives an atlas of the known extrasolar planets with some nice interactive displays. &nbsp;See the excellent <a href="http://exoplanets.org/" target="_blank">Exoplanets Orbit Database</a> (maintained by Penn State Professor Jason Wright and his advisees)&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<a href="http://exoplanet.eu/" style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; font-weight: bold; " target="_blank">Extrasolar Planets Encyclopaedia</a>&nbsp;for details on each known planet. &nbsp; These have interactive data tools that can be used to make&nbsp;histogram and correlation plots such as those show in some of the online lectures. &nbsp;These catalog list thousands of planets and planetary systems, and&nbsp;the numbers continue to grow during the course of the semester. &nbsp;You may&nbsp;notice that the number of exoplanets on each site doesn't match exactly. &nbsp;There are a variety of reasons, ranging from which site was updated most recently to the curators making different judgements about which planets should be included.</p>

<p>Michael Perryman has been a leading figure in the European Space Agency's efforts to find planets around other stars. &nbsp;He is also author of a major advanced text in the field.&nbsp; <strong><a href="http://luth7.obspm.fr/20150708-macp-detection-methods.pdf" onclick="window.open(this.href, '', 'resizable=yes,status=no,location=no,toolbar=no,menubar=no,fullscreen=no,scrollbars=no,dependent=no'); return false;">His diagram</a></strong>, now a few years out of date, &nbsp;summarizes the success of different methods for finding planets. The different branches of the tree show different methods. &nbsp;The depth of the tree downwards indicates how sensitive the method is for discovering smaller planets. &nbsp;On the axis on the left side, M<sub>J</sub> refers to one Jupiter mass and M<sub>O</sub> (circle with a plus inside) refers to one Earth mass. &nbsp;Numbers at the bottom indicates how many planets or multiple-planet systems had been found with each method (as of 2015). &nbsp;Dotted lines indicate technologies under development but not yet achieved. I suggest that you come back to this summary after you have studied about the various methods this week.&nbsp;</p>
