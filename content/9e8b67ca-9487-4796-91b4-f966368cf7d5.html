<p>On Earth, scientists study the complicated interactions in the world around us, often tracing `cycles' that show how some feature begins, develops, and ends. Some involve physical components (such as the `water cycle': evaporation from oceans, rain and rivers flow back to oceans, some is captures in ice caps) while others involve living organisms (such as the life cycle of a human from birth through childhood, adulthood, aging and death). Similarly, astronomers can trace the physical cycles and interactions in a Galaxy, and of its components (such as the interstellar medium, stars and planets). Here we discuss the life cycle of individual stars. Stars are crucial for life in the universe:&nbsp;without the chemical elements they produce, planets would be made only of gases; and without&nbsp;their heat, planets would be too cold to sustain life.</p>
