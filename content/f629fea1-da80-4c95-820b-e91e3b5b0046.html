<h2>Planetary Transit Method</h2>
<p><strong><em>This topic is covered in section 6.4, rather briefly considering its great importance today. &nbsp;Here the math is easy: equation (6.9) shows that the radius of the planet (R<sub>p</sub>) divided by the radius of the host star (R<sub>*</sub>) can be easily measured from the fraction of starlight obscured during the transit. &nbsp;Figure 6.11 shows recent data on the first planetary transit discovered around star HD 209458.&nbsp;</em></strong></p>
<p>When a planet's orbit happens, by chance, to be aligned along the line-of-sight between Earth and the host star, then the planet's disk will pass in front of the star's disk and eclipse a tiny fraction of the starlight. &nbsp;This is called the&nbsp;<strong>transit</strong>&nbsp;of a planet across the star. &nbsp;The phenomenon has been well-known for centuries because, every few years, Venus transits across the Sun's disk as seen from Earth. &nbsp;This was historically important because it allowed accurate measurement of the Earth-Sun distance in the 1700-1800s. &nbsp;The latest transit of Venus took place last summer, June 5-6 2012, and was visible to U.S. amateur astronomers with telescopes equipped to image the sun. The next transit is in 2117, but you can see a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z9rM8ChTjY" target="_blank">NASA movie of the transit</a>. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The diagrams below illustrate the phenomena involving a planet orbiting another star. &nbsp;The starlight brightness dims slightly when the planet transits; this dip is typically 0.01-1% of the light, so the brightness measurements must be very accurate. &nbsp;This is best achieved using a telescope on a satellite in space where the shimmering of our atmosphere is not present. &nbsp;If the orbital speed of the planet is known from radial velocity measurements, its radius can be directly measured by the duration of the eclipse ingress and egress (the short tilted lines in the brightness diagrams below).&nbsp;</p>

The best understanding arises when&nbsp;<em><strong>both</strong></em>&nbsp;transit and radial velocity observations are available for the same system - knowing the planet's size and mass, we can calculate its average density, which gives a strong idea of its composition (see Fig. 7.12 on page 254 of our textbook). &nbsp;</p>

This is a telescope orbiting Earth (left panel below) with a huge CCD camera (right panel below... your cell phone probably has a small CCD camera) that observed the brightness of ~160,000 stars at a time. &nbsp;The satellite system reported the brightness of each star roughly once every thirty minutes nearly continuously for four years. &nbsp;(While many stars have variable brightness for some reason (magnetic starspots, binary star companion), others are very nearly constant and one can sensitively search for tiny periodic dips due to the transit of a planet. As we will see in coming lectures, the Kepler mission has revolutionized planet detection with several thousand&nbsp;candidate planets. Today, most of the planets known&nbsp;were identified by the Kepler mission. &nbsp;Most of the planets it finds are in planetary systems having multiple planets, and many of the systems exhibiting remarkable properties.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Transit Timing Method</h3>
<p>When a planet is observed to transit its host star, it will transit the star every orbit, in a highly predictable fashion. In fact, the transits will follow one another with absolutely clock-like regularity...&nbsp;<strong>unless</strong> the planet's orbital motions are being perturbed by the gravitational influence of other planets in the system. In the latter case, we can expect to observe&nbsp;<strong>transit timing variations</strong>&nbsp;- subtle drifting of the transit times, compared to an exactly periodic signal - which will (in time) reveal the mass and orbit of the perturbing planet. This entirely different method of planet discovery has been maturing at a furious rate thanks to the continuing observations of the <strong>Kepler</strong> mission, which not only detects planets in transit, but also continues to observe them as they transit their host star, over and over again. &nbsp;&nbsp;Penn State&nbsp;Professor Eric Ford was a member of the Kepler Science team and&nbsp;one of the leaders of studying multiple-planet systems with transit timing variations. &nbsp;</p><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rqQ1xKsNIQE" width="640"></iframe>
