<h2>Asteroids</h2>
<p>Asteroids and comets are small rocky and icy bodies left over from the Sun's protoplanetary disk. The term "asteroid" is used to refer to billions of small rocky bodies of a vast range of sizs that orbit the Sun. Most of them are in roughly circular orbits in the <strong>Asteroid Belt</strong> between Mars & Jupiter. It is likely that gravitational perturbations of Jupiter and, to a much lesser extent, Mars prevented the formation of a bona fide planet at this orbit in the Solar System.&nbsp;Some asteroids have unusual orbits, such as the <strong>Trojan Asteroids</strong> that are found tracking Jupiter's orbit in two "clouds" centered 60 degrees ahead of and behind the giant planet. &nbsp;The figure below shows asteroids with known orbits ... this is not an artist's painting, but a plot of the real locations of the larger & brighter bodies in the Asteroid Belt.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>A relatively small number of asteroids have had their orbits altered by Jupiter's gravity and can approach Earth. <strong>Meteors</strong> (also called 'shooting stars', though they have nothing to do with stars!)&nbsp;are fragments of asteroids or comet material which burn up in Earth's atmosphere, making a brief streak in the sky. <strong>Meteorites</strong>&nbsp;are the pieces that don't burn up and land on Earth where they can be collected and studied in detail. Meteorites landing in most places are hard to distinguish from regular Earth rocks, so most meteorites are found in deserts or on the polar ice caps (e.g., Greenland or Antarctica). &nbsp;</p>
<p>In recent years, a few asteroids have&nbsp; been photographed by robotic probes during close fly-bys: Eros, Ida and its tiny 'moon' Dactyl, Mathilde, and most recently Vesta. The fly-bys have revealed that the surfaces of these asteroids are rocky (silicate) with craters from impacts by other asteroids. In 2001, the robotic NEAR probe crashed into Eros, taking closeup photos on the way in. Mathilde is darker and less dense; it may be a less well-bound, loose 'rubble pile' containing mostly sooty carbonaceous material. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Asteroids occasionally come close to planets and collide with them. Asteroid collisions of sufficient size will produce impact craters. The Moon and Mercury show many such craters, showing that our Solar System is a hazardous environment; most of the craters on Earth, Venus, and Mars have been erased over time by volcanism and erosion. Below left is a relatively new crater on Earth that you can visit in Arizona. Below right is an older, heavily eroded, &nbsp;crater in Canada from 200 Myr ago. &nbsp;A huge crater from a ~10 km-size asteroid that impacted 65 million years ago was identified under water, off the coast of Mexico's Yucatan peninsula. Some combination of the tidal waves (tsunamis), atmospheric debris, hemisphere-spanning forest fires, and Sun-obscuring dust and soot that followed this impact probably killed most land-based life on Earth, leading to the extinction of the dinosaurs and many other species that marks the Cretaceous-Tertiary ("K-T") boundary in the geological record. It is suspected that asteroid or comet impacts were also responsible for some of the other mass extinctions in Earth's past. Astronomical efforts are under way to discover and map out the orbits of all large asteroids with orbits that could allow them to hit Earth, so that we will have enough warning to organize evacuations (for small objects) or deflect the asteroid's orbit (for large objects). Deflecting the orbit of a large asteroid would require a dedicated space mission and years of advance warning to be successful. Luckily, the&nbsp;chances are low that an impact large enough to have an impact on a global scale&nbsp;will occur in the next ~thousand years. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Meteorites, which are pieces of asteroids landing on Earth, can be studied in the laboratory in great detail to tell us about ancient planetisimals. Their properties are surprisingly diverse and complex. Most seem to be made of rock similar to Earth and Moon, but much of the rock is in small melted spheres called chondrules. &nbsp;Some are iron-rich and must have been formed inside melted ('differentiated') planetisimals. Others are definitely unmelted; they still have grains inherited from the Galactic material from which the solar system formed long ago. &nbsp;Below left is an ordinary chondritic meteorite. &nbsp;Below right is a piece of the Murchison meteorite, a rare type of&nbsp;carbonaceous chondrite&nbsp;where amino acids and other organic molecules have been found. &nbsp;</p>

This is a very important carbonaceous chondrite that dates from the beginning of the Sun's protoplanetary disk.  The small melted rocks are chondrules.  The matrix in between is a hydrocarbon similar to soot or coal.  This carbon may have been important for the origin of  life on Earth." class="lightbox" src="/_legacy/astro140/allende.jpg" style="cursor: default; border-width: 0px; border-style: initial; border-color: initial; width: 275px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img alt="" src="/_legacy/astro140/Murchison_meteorite_0.459g.jpg" style="width: 304px; height: 338px; "></div>

<h2>Comets</h2>
<p>Comets, like asteroids, are debris left over from the solar nebula and the formation of the Solar System. While asteroids are rocky bodies found (for the most part) in the Asteroid Belt between Mars and Jupiter, comets are mainly icy bodies that are found (for the most part) in the outer reaches of the Solar System in the Kuiper Belt, beginning just beyond the orbit of Neptune, and in the spherical Oort Cloud, far beyond at 50,000 AU, which effectively defines the edge of the Solar System. Most cometary bodies never come into the inner Solar System. Occasionally, however, a comet's orbit is altered by some gravitational encounter and it zooms towards the Sun. Its orbit typically has an eccentricity of e=99%, a semi-major axis of a=50,000 AU, and an orbital period of P~10<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;years. A few comets that enter the inner reaches of the Solar System in this way are redirected into shorter orbits and become "periodic" comets; the most famous of these is Halley's Comet with an orbital period P=76 years. Below are some photos from the last passage of Comet Halley near Earth in 1986. We now have close-up images of several comets from robotic probes: they are irregularly shaped, loosly packed bodies of water ice, rocks, and dust.&nbsp;</p>

<div>Amazingly, astronomers witnessed the collision of a comet with Jupiter in 1994! The comet was broken into fragments by Jupiter's gravitational tidal forces on its first close passage by the planet in July 1992&nbsp;and impacted the planet on its next orbit over July 16 to 22, 1994. These impacts resulted in huge disruptions to the atmosphere of Jupiter&nbsp;which were observed from Earth-based observatories, the Hubble Space Telescope, and the Galileo spacecraft, then on its way to Jupter. Here are pictures before and after the collision taken by the Hubble Space Telescope.&nbsp;</div>

<div><h2>Kuiper Belt Objects (KBOs)</h2>
<p>Recently, astronomers have discovered hundreds of Solar System bodies in orbits beyond Neptune. These are called Trans-Neptunian Objects (TNOs) or Kuiper Belt Objects (KBOs, named after astronomer Gerard Kuiper). &nbsp;We now know that Pluto is thus just one among a huge number of rocky/icy bodies in the outer solar system. In the "zoom out" of the Solar System below, the upper-right panel has the best scale to show the Kuiper Belt (labeled in cyan). &nbsp;</p></div>
<p><img alt="Orbits in the inner and outer Solar System" class="lightbox" src="/_legacy/astro140/sed3orb.jpg" style="width: 60%;"></p>
<p>The Kuiper Belt extends from 30 to 50 AU, with a sharp outer edge that is not well explained by current models. The Kuiper Belt objects are probably primitive objects, largely unchanged since the formation of the Solar System. Those with approximately circular orbits have probably had these orbits since birth, while those with more elliptical orbits - including Pluto - have experienced gravitational interactions wtih Neptune.</p>
<p>Pluto, and several other known Kuiper Belt objects, orbit the Sun twice in the time Neptune orbits it three times; they have a mean orbital radius of ~39 AU (with various individual eccentricities and inclinations) which puts their orbit in "resonance" with Neptune's, making their orbits stable over long timescales. Pluto has three moons (below). In 2006, NASA launched the <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/newhorizons/main" target="_blank"><em>New Horizons</em></a> mission to Pluto and hopefully one or two other KBOs. It flew&nbsp;by Pluto and its moons in 2015 and is scheduled to fly by 2014 MU69 near January 1, 2019. &nbsp;Watch some of the amazing &nbsp;<a href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/newhorizons/videos/index.html" target="_blank">videos containing images obtained by New Horizons during the Pluto and Charon encounters</a>.</p>

<p>The artist's painting below shows the largest KBOs known so far. Eris is slightly bigger than Pluto, and the others are somewhat smaller. Because Pluto is no longer alone, the international astronomers' society classified all of these Kuiper Belt objects including Pluto as 'dwarf planets' in 2005 - the famous "demotion of Pluto". Sedna, alone among these trans-Neptunian objects, is not a Kuiper Belt object, since its orbit extends out to 937 AU and inward only as far as 76 AU which is beyond the edge of the Kuiper Belt (see the diagram of Sedna's orbit, as a red ellipse, in the lower-right panel of the figure above). Sedna is likely a former Oort Cloud object which has experienced multiple gravitational perturbations leading to its current position.&nbsp;</p>
