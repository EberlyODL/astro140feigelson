    <title>Course Overview</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;The possible existence of life beyond Earth is one of the most fundamental questions relating the human race to the physical Universe around us. While considerations of extraterrestrial life were in the domains of philosophy and science fiction in the past, today we have considerable scientific knowledge that can be applied to the question. Advances in modern astronomy have dramatically improved our understanding of our cosmic surroundings: tracing the cosmic origins of biological molecules, direct evidence for planets around most stars (exoplanets), and a deeper understanding of planet formation have all emerged in the past generation.&amp;nbsp; Several fields -- geology, biochemistry, paleontology (fossils), evolutionary biology --&amp;nbsp; give insight (though not a complete understanding) on how life arose on Earth, and spacecraft travel provides constraints on life elsewhere in our Solar System.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results from studies on Earth, the Solar System, and exoplanets across the Galaxy together indicate that the conditions for life are widespread in the Universe; extraterrestrial life has not been found yet, but does not seem implausible. Interstellar space travel between habitable planets, by humans or other beings, is exceedingly difficult but not physically impossible.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The course is thus rooted in modern science, but is connected to the long-standing philosophical question: Are we alone in the Universe? Today, this question is often embedded in science fiction (such as movies about aliens) and discussion about whether aliens have visited Earth.&amp;nbsp; Today, astronomical studies are leading the way in answering part of the question:&amp;nbsp; Earth-like planets seem&amp;nbsp;to be extremely common.&amp;nbsp; But there is no evidence yet for life beyond&amp;nbsp;Earth. &amp;nbsp;The course satisfies the General Natural Sciences (GN) component of the General Education requirements for a Bachelors degree from Penn State. &amp;nbsp;It requires the student has prior experience with an introductory astronomy course, but a background with another science course (e.g. biology, geology, chemistry)&amp;nbsp;at the university level may suffice. &amp;nbsp;Students in this situation should contact the instructor during Drop/Add period to discuss whether the class is appropriate.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What You Will Learn&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The course naturally will give the student opportunity to learn lots of exciting new scientific discoveries in astronomy with strong elements of chemistry, geology and biology. &amp;nbsp;These findings are integrated around the basic question "Is there life in the Universe outside Earth?". &amp;nbsp; In addition to acquisition of knowledge, the course will return several times to discuss how science progresses, what science can tell us, and how it relates to other forms of thinking. &amp;nbsp;Finally, the course seeks to teach an important skill called `science writing'. &amp;nbsp;Here the student gathers information from diverse scientific sources and writes informative, well-organized, and well-phrased essays in a formal style that deemphasizes personal opinion and includes citations to scientific literature. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Course Objectives&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The course objectives for students to achieve during the semester are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Knowledge &amp; Comprehension:&lt;/em&gt; Define vocabulary. List facts and observational data that enable you to participate in scientific discussions regarding the potential for life beyond Earth. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Application &amp; Analysis: &lt;/em&gt;Describe the purpose and implications of scientific experiments and observations. Explain how the results have led to the current state of scientific understanding. Apply scientific reasoning to deduce the implications of hypothetical experiments and observations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Synthesis:&lt;/em&gt; Explain how future experiments or observations could address open questions about the origins of life and potential for life beyond Earth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Evaluation: &lt;/em&gt;Critically evaluate claims and identify the extent to which data is inconclusive.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reading the textbook and online lessons will enable students meet the objectives of&amp;nbsp;Knowledge &amp; Comprehension. &amp;nbsp;Posting and reading&amp;nbsp;discussion board posts will help students meet objectives of Application &amp; Analysis&amp;nbsp;and give the opportunties to begin synthesizing and evaluating scientific claims. &amp;nbsp;The Synthesis &amp; Evaluation objectives will be further developed through writing two&amp;nbsp;papers. &amp;nbsp;Participating in a citizen science project will provide students experience analyzing real scientific data and positioningn them to&amp;nbsp;synthesize their understanding of the scientific process. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Students will be assessed via a combination of&amp;nbsp;online quizzes (Knowledge &amp; Comprehension and Application &amp; Analysis), discusssion board posts (some&amp;nbsp;Knowledge &amp; Comprehension, but&amp;nbsp;primarily&amp;nbsp;Application &amp; Analysis), a class project (Application &amp; Analysis), and two papers (Synthesis &amp; Evaluation).&lt;/p&gt;</body>

    <title>Course Navigation (CCW, Canvas, VoiceThreads)</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;This course uses three interfaces. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. For quizzes, exams, discussions, submission of the project and papers, as well as e-mail communication and Course Announcements, the course will use the &lt;a href="http://canvas.psu.edu" target="_blank"&gt;Canvas Course Management System&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. &amp;nbsp;The interface that you are currently using will help to&amp;nbsp;organize and deliver much of the course content, through a combination of web pages and videos. We will refer to this interface as the Course Content Website (CCW). &amp;nbsp;You can bookmark it at&amp;nbsp;&lt;a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=https://courses.ed.science.psu.edu/astro140/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1470243355983000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGc8NsSaRTWd1hnKubHN31aSnhmvA" href="https://courses.ed.science.psu.edu/astro140/" target="_blank"&gt;https://courses.ed.science.&lt;wbr&gt;psu.edu/astro140/&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;or access each lesson from the corresponding module inside Canvas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. &amp;nbsp;Roughly once a week, the instructor will provide brief videos discussing the upcoming course content, discussing results of recent quizzes or other material, or some particular issue about the class. &amp;nbsp;These videos will be provided through the Voicethread system at Penn State; see &lt;a href="http://voicethread.psu.edu/voicethread-student-quick-start-guide/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; for an introduction. &amp;nbsp;The videos will appear in your Web browser within the lecture pages. In some cases, you may need to reload a page in order for the video to update. While you shouldn't need to enter the Voicethread system directly each week, you can via &lt;a href="https://psu.voicethread.com/myvoice/group/1159117" target="_blank"&gt;https://psu.voicethread.com/myvoice/group/1159117&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;Note that at the beginning of the semester, you must join the Voicethread `group' for our class &amp;nbsp;at the following URL:&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://psu.voicethread.com/groups/subscribe/1159117/84507bce3/" target="_blank"&gt;https://psu.voicethread.com/groups/subscribe/1159117/84507bce3/&lt;/a&gt; .&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important that you make sure that you are able to access this course via all three interfaces. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;At the top of all of the course pages in the CCW, you will notice a icon&amp;nbsp;with a picture of a book and the word outline, which you can click to access a&amp;nbsp;menu for the course content that lives within the CCW. &amp;nbsp;As you progress through the content, the menu expands to the right, creating breadcrumbs for you to navigate back through the content. You may also use the buttons at the bottom of your screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will navigate to Canvas (&lt;a href="http://canvas.psu.edu" target="_blank"&gt;canvas.psu.edu&lt;/a&gt;) anytime you are required to complete a quiz, participate in a Discussion Forum, or submit your paper or project. &amp;nbsp;The content is arranged by Modules/Lessons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There may be times (e.g., near assignment deadlines) when&amp;nbsp;it is important that you notice messages sent to your Canvas account promptly. &amp;nbsp;Therefore, many students choose to&amp;nbsp;configure their Canvas email account to forward messages to an email or SMS account. &amp;nbsp; See 'Account' in the left menu and then 'Settings.'&amp;nbsp; In the far right menu, you can add emails or SMS contacts. (If you go back to&amp;nbsp;the 'Account' link in the left menu, then you can&amp;nbsp;adjust your 'Notifications'&amp;nbsp;to send a copy of all of your course emails to your active personal email address, be it your PSU email or other personal account. &amp;nbsp; Note that messages sent via Canvas may include discussion of your course grades. &amp;nbsp;If you choose to forward&amp;nbsp;these messages to accounts outside of Canvas, then you may be compromising the privacy of such information.) &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember to logout of the Astro&amp;nbsp;140&amp;nbsp;course content site and&amp;nbsp;Canvas when you are done. The correct logout is important if you use a computer shared by many users (such as in computer labs) to prevent unauthorized access to your account and personal information such as grades. &amp;nbsp;Closing the browser tab or the browser window&amp;nbsp;DOES&amp;nbsp;NOT&amp;nbsp;terminate the connection - “logging out” is important to preserve your privacy and&amp;nbsp;work.&lt;/p&gt;</body>

    <title>Instructions for Papers</title>
    <body>&lt;h5&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Papers for ASTRO 140 Life in the Universe&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;GOALS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Provide students with the opportunity to investigate a narrow scientific issue in some detail;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Challenge the student to assimilate diverse information into a coherent narrative;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Provide training in the art of scientific writing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TOPICS  &lt;/strong&gt; Paper topics should be chosen from the list of recommended topics (with recommended research materials) provided by the instructor later in the semester.  A student with a strond desire for a special topic should present it, with ideas for research materials, for prior approval by the instructor.  Our textbook and Wikipedia provide useful starting points for your research on most topics, but are not enough by themselves for a strong paper.  If you have difficulty identifying resources (or obtaining full-text versions), please freely contact the instructor. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LENGTH AND FORMAT   The typical length is 3-4 pages text followed by pages for references and useful figures (perhaps .jpg taken from the Web). A cover page can be added.  The paper should be submitted prepared with a word processing system like Microsoft Word or Google Docs. The text is single-spaced with Arial or Times Roman font, 12pt font size, with 1" margins for 8.5x11 inch or A4 paper.  Papers may be submitted in either .docx or .pdf fomat with file names like "Lastname_Paper1.pdf".    &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RESEARCH MATERIAL AND REFERENCING Each paper should make significant use of at least three sources beyond the text and Wikipedia.  Sources can include both general background sources and specialized sources;  it is great to have one or more peer-review research journal articles.   All sources(except the text and Wikipedia) should be included in the list of references and cited in the text.  Avoid many similar citations to the same source.  The example here in red illustrates referencing of book, article and Web material:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color:#B22222;"&gt;&lt;span class="foundation_access-secondary_color "&gt;Cyanobacteria, also called blue-green algae, is not commonly seen today but dominated all lifeforms before the Cambrian Explosion 0.5 billion years ago.  Through photosynthesis, it had a dramatic effect on the composition of the Earth's atmosphere around 2 billion years ago (Kasting 2005, Chpt. 4; Lane 2010).  American and Australian geobiologists recently traced the genetic family tree of cyanobacteria found that only one of dozens of species evolved to produce oxygen (Perkins 2017).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color:#B22222;"&gt;&lt;span class="foundation_access-secondary_color "&gt;Kasting, J. 2010, &lt;em&gt;How to Find a Habitable Earth&lt;/em&gt;, Princeton Univ Press&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Lane" title="Nick Lane"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#B22222;"&gt;Lane, Nick&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="color:#B22222;"&gt; 2010, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20527461-100-first-breath-earths-billion-year-struggle-for-oxygen/" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#B22222;"&gt;"First breath: Earth's billion-year struggle for oxygen"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="color:#B22222;"&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Scientist" title="New Scientist"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#B22222;"&gt;New Scientist&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="color:#B22222;"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="color:#B22222;"&gt; February pp36–9&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color:#B22222;"&gt;Perkins, R. 2017, "How do plants make oxygen? Ask cyanobacteria", press release,  http://www.caltech.edu/news/how-do-plants-make-oxygen-ask-cyanobacteria-54559&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GRADING  The grade will be based foughly equally on (a) the knowledge and understanding of the issue under study, and (b) the clarity and quality of the communication (Science Writing below).  For Paper 1, students will submit a draft to the instructor for suggestions on how to improve the organization and writing.  It need not be complete but should have at least: a detailed outline of the paper structure, two or more fully written paragraphs, and research references for the full paper.   The instructor will then return it with comments and suggestions for improvement to help the student write a strong paper.  Paper II will be written by the student independently based on a different set of topics provided by the instructor.  Paper I draft is worth 2%, Paper I completed 10%, and Paper II 15% of the course grade. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SCIENCE WRITING  Quality science writing is a skill well worth developing and exercising. The paper's overall organization looks like a U: it begins with a short statement of motivation or scientific issue; most of the text presents the evidence or argument (some combination of empirical findings and scientific modelling); and the paper ends with a discussion of how the results relate to the original motivation. Within this framework, the paragraphs should follow a logical trail. Each paragraph should communicate one thought clearly.  Within a paragraph, sentences should be well-constructed.  Nouns and verbs should be informative (e.g. "The Martian photographs show ..." rather than "It was found ...").  First person pronouns should be avoided (e.g. not "I" or "my").  Colloquialisms and cliches should be avoided (e.g. "The experiment failed" rather than "It was a dismal failure").  Please read the following background materia: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://online.science.psu.edu/sites/default/files/astro140/Feigelson%20advice.rtf" target="_blank"&gt;Eric Feigelson's general advice for astronomy writing&lt;/a&gt; (download)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.astro.indiana.edu/catyp/science_write.html" target="_blank"&gt;Caty Pilachowski's tips for astronomy writing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://online.science.psu.edu/sites/default/files/astro140/William%20Safire%27s%20Rules.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;William Safire's rules for writers&lt;/a&gt; (humorous)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://online.science.psu.edu/sites/default/files/astro140/Writing%20in%20the%20sciences.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Writing in the sciences&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://online.science.psu.edu/sites/default/files/astro140/Astro%20writing%20problems.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Astro writing problems&lt;/a&gt; (Feigelson)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ACADEMIC INTEGRITY &lt;em&gt;Plagiarism is strictly prohibited.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; See the University document &lt;a href="https://psu.box.com/v/PlagiarismAndYou"&gt;https://psu.box.com/v/PlagiarismAndYou&lt;/a&gt; for more details.  The presence of plagiarized text will be checked using specialized University-provided software. For example, you are not permitted to cut and paste text from the Web.   &lt;strong&gt;Extensive quotations from any source are also inappropriate.  R&lt;/strong&gt;ather, the student should seek to understand and restate the issues in a new voice, summarizing and synthesizing diverse material (with appropriate reference).   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SUBMISSION A draft of Paper 1 is due &lt;b&gt;Friday February 9, &lt;/b&gt;final version of Paper 1 is due &lt;b&gt;Friday March 2, &lt;/b&gt;and Paper 2 is due by &lt;b&gt;Monday April 30&lt;/b&gt; (first day of Exam Week)&lt;b&gt;.  &lt;/b&gt;Each of these writing assignments is to be submitted via &lt;a href="http://canvas.psu.edu" target="_blank"&gt;Canvas&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Students are strongly encouraged to informally consult with the instructor as they progress with the papers. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</body>

    <title>Paper 2 Topics</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;The recommended topics for Paper 2 concern exoplanet discoveries, properties, and implications. &amp;nbsp;While you can rely on information designed for the public (news releases, Wikipedia), I hope that most of you will delve into the research literature, at least for part of your paper. You can find the research&amp;nbsp;papers on the `arXiv e-print' button of the ADS Web site. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Building on your experience with Paper I, your essay should be well-organized with an introduction / motivation, substantive scientific content, and brief conclusion. &amp;nbsp;Length is&amp;nbsp;2-3 pages of text (single spaced) with added figures and references. &amp;nbsp;The `science writing' style should be enforced: after you draft the text, revise it to remove `I/We' opinions, weak sentence structures (`This is ...'), colloquialisms (`once in a while...'), exaggerations (`amazing'), and excessive quotes.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Emphasize clear presentation of scientific findings and interpretations. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have a different topic from Themes IV (Planetary systems in the Galaxy) or V (Life around other stars) that you strongly prefer to write about, send the instructor an email with title, scope/outline, and initial references. &amp;nbsp;You can proceed only if the instructor approves the topic. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TRAPPIST 1. &amp;nbsp;One of the most exciting exoplanetary systems,&amp;nbsp;TRAPPIST 1 is&amp;nbsp;a very nearby (12 parsecs), very low-mass star with roughly 10% the size and mass of our Sun.&amp;nbsp; It has seven (!) detected transiting Earth-sized planets;&amp;nbsp; three reside in the Habitable Zone.&amp;nbsp; Dozens research papers have been written about this system in the past two years, so your essay should concentrate on some particular aspect: models for its formation; the `resonance’ and ‘tidal locking’ of the planets; atmospheres of the planets; evidence for water on the planets; effects of stellar flares and X-rays on habitability.&amp;nbsp; Wikipedia has an excellent article that lays the groundwork, and the following references provide details on different aspects of the system. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;_____ &lt;strong&gt;Choice of Topic (6%)&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6:&amp;nbsp; The topic is appropriate to the course focused narrowly enough for the scope of this assignment.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;The topic is appropriate to the course and focused, but lacks direction.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2:&amp;nbsp; The topic is appropriate to the course, but too broad or too narrow for the scope of this assignment.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;0:&amp;nbsp; The topic is appropriate to the course and/or not clearly defined.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6: Paragraph/section development present but not perfected.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4: Logical organization; organization of ideas not fully developed.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2: Limited evidence of structure or organization.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;0: No evidence of structure or organization.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;8:&amp;nbsp; The paper demonstrates that the author fully understands the references being reviewed and has applied concepts learned in the course. Concepts are integrated into the writer’s own insights. The writer provides concluding remarks that show analysis and synthesis of ideas, with conclusions supported in both the body of the paper and cited sources.&amp;nbsp;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6:&amp;nbsp; The paper demonstrates that the author, for the most part, understands the references being reviewed and has applied concepts learned in the course. Some of the conclusions, however, are not supported in the body of the paper and cited sources.&amp;nbsp;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4:&amp;nbsp; The paper demonstrates that the author, to a certain extent, understands the references being reviewed and has applied concepts learned in the course.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2:&amp;nbsp; The paper does not demonstrate that the author has fully understood the references being reviewed or that the author has not applied concepts learned in the course.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;0:&amp;nbsp; The paper does not demonstrate that the author has fully understood the references being reviewed and that the author has not applied concepts learned in the course.

&lt;p&gt;6:&amp;nbsp; In-depth discussion &amp; elaboration in most sections of the paper.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4:&amp;nbsp; In-depth discussion &amp; elaboration in some sections of the paper.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2:&amp;nbsp; The writer has omitted pertinent content or content runs-on excessively. Quotations from others outweigh the writer’s own ideas excessively.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;0:&amp;nbsp; Cursory discussion in all the sections of the paper or brief discussion in only a few sections.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;_____ Cohesiveness (8%)&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;8:&amp;nbsp; Ties together information from all sources. Paper flows from one issue to the next without the need for headings. Author's writing demonstrates an understanding of the relationship among material obtained from all sources.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6:&amp;nbsp; For the most part, ties together information from all sources. Paper flows with only some disjointedness. Author's writing demonstrates an understanding of the relationship among material obtained from all sources.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4:&amp;nbsp; Sometimes ties together information from all sources. Paper does not flow - disjointedness is apparent. Author's writing does not demonstrate an understanding of all the relationship among material obtained from all sources.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2:&amp;nbsp; Does not tie together information. Paper does not flow and appears to be created from disparate issues. Writing does not demonstrate understanding of multiple relationships among material obtained from all sources.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;0:&amp;nbsp; Absent, no cohesiveness

    <title>Instructions for PlanetHunters project (not yet available)</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;In this project, you will contribute to an actual citizen science research effort to analyze real astronomical data from NASA's Kepler spacecraft. Your contribution will help astronomers learn about how many stars in our galaxy might have planets orbiting them. This is a serious project that will take several hours to complete, so please plan ahead and budget your time accordingly. &amp;nbsp; You may choose to read about the project now, and perhaps even to start on this project the very first week. &amp;nbsp;That said, I fully expect that students will proceed to lessons for Theme 1, and come back to this page later as they make progress on the project. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Your mission:&lt;/em&gt; Look for planet transits and classify light curves from NASA’s Kepler spacecraft based on the star’s temporal variability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I. Getting Started&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, make sure you have watched my&amp;nbsp;PlanetHunters video tutorial&amp;nbsp;that&amp;nbsp;provides an overview of how to use the PlanetHunters website to hunt for planets and to recognize other causes of stellar variability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="450" src="https://psu.voicethread.com/app/player/?threadId=8064118" width="800"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, go to the PlanetHunters website (&lt;a href="http://PlanetHunters.org" target="_blank"&gt;http://PlanetHunters.org&lt;/a&gt;), sign up for an account (or log in again if you already created an account), and complete the introductory tutorial.&amp;nbsp; Go ahead and quickly inspect at least few light curves looking for any possible transits, just to get the hang of it.&amp;nbsp; Then, explore the other features of the website, as described in the video tutorial.&amp;nbsp; In particular, review the different types of light curves you may see in the “Spotter’s Guide”.&amp;nbsp; Once you are ready to start the main part of the project, continue to section 2.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;II.&amp;nbsp; Inspect &amp; Classify Light Curves &lt;/strong&gt;(30%)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this step, you will inspect and classify at least 50 light curves.&amp;nbsp; You’ll record your results into a data tables, using one row for each light curve you examine.&amp;nbsp; First, make sure you are logged into Planethunters.org, click the “Start Classifying Planets” button or “Classify” tab to get started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inspect your first light curve and draw a box around any potential transits, as described in the tutorial. &amp;nbsp;Before you move on, classify each light curve according to the type of stellar activity using the following three categories:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;a) &lt;em&gt;Quiet&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;:&lt;/em&gt; This is for light curves that do not show systematic variation. Any vertical scatter in the points is attributed to "noise". The spread of the scatter should be no more than about 0.05%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;b) &lt;em&gt;Spotty&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;:&lt;/em&gt; These light curves show clear and generally smooth variation.&amp;nbsp; There will not necessarily be a systematic repeating pattern, but there are often quaesi-periodic variations with a timescale of days to weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;c) &lt;em&gt;Pulsating&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;:&lt;/em&gt; These light curves also show clear variation, and with a quaesi-periodic pattern that repeats. The timescale of the pulsations are typically minutes to hours, significantly more rapid than spotty stars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Record your interpretation into a &lt;a href="https://psu.box.com/v/planethunterstable" target="_blank"&gt;data table&lt;/a&gt; using one row per light curve (see next page).&amp;nbsp; For each light curve, record your classification it into one of the three categories by placing a 1 in that column. Place zeros in the boxes for the other categories of stellar activity in the same row.&amp;nbsp; There are two additional columns to indicate if you identify a potential transit and for any notes you wish to record.&amp;nbsp; If you think you see one or more transits, enter the number of potential transits in the Transits column.&amp;nbsp; Note that you might not see any real planet transits during your entire project.&amp;nbsp; (If you mark a light curve as containing a transit, it should also be marked as belonging to one of the previous three categories.) Once you’re ready to move on, click the button at the bottom right (either “No Transits” or “Finished”).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next screen will have some additional information.&amp;nbsp; Record the “Zooniverse id” (at the bottom left in small font) for the star you just classified into your data table.&amp;nbsp; If you found something interesting, consider marking the light curve as a “Favorite” and/or leaving a comment about what interested you.&amp;nbsp; This will make it easier for you to come back to review your most interesting light curves near the end of the project.&amp;nbsp; Now, click next subject, and repeat for the next light curve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Repeat the above process for at least 50 stars.&amp;nbsp; I encourage you to take breaks, so you stay fresh.&amp;nbsp; You can return as many time as you like over multiple days (remember your username) to classify dozens of light curves.&amp;nbsp; If you choose to use a printed copy of the &lt;a href="https://psu.box.com/v/planethunterstable" target="_blank"&gt;data table&lt;/a&gt;, then you will need to print out several pages.&amp;nbsp; If you are using a spreadsheet with your data table, then add new rows as necessary to contain all your results. When you are finished, every box should have a number in it. Do not leave any boxes blank when you submit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Suggestion:&amp;nbsp; &lt;/em&gt;You will report your results of Sections III, IV &amp; V in the Canvas via the assignment named "PlanetHunter Project Results".&amp;nbsp; I suggest that you print out a copy of the questions you'll be asked to answer from Canvas, and perform the analysis and calculations in sections III &amp; IV, writing down your responses as you go (either on paper or a text file).&amp;nbsp; Then you go back into the Canvas assignment, upload your data table from section II, enter your results from Section III &amp; IV, and respond to the final questions in Section V.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;III.&amp;nbsp; Analyze your Data &amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;(30%)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1.&amp;nbsp; Review your data table.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’ll report a summary of your results in Count the total number of light curves you classified (and recorded in your data table).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha;"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Count the number of light curves that you categorized as “quiet”.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Count the number of light curves that you classified as “spotty”.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Count the number of light curves that you classified as “pulsating”.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Count the number of light curves that you identified as having a potential transit.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Compute the percentage of light curves that you classified into each category.&amp;nbsp; You can use the formula:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Percentage in given category = 100% * (Number in category) / (Total Number Inspected).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What is the percentage of light curves that you identified as having a potential transit?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2.&amp;nbsp; Review your most interesting light curves. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, that you’ve reviewed many light curves, you are likely to be able to recognize common patterns more easily.&amp;nbsp; Go back to review the light curves that you marked as potentially containing a transit.&amp;nbsp; (If you didn’t mark at least three as likely to contain a transiting planet, then use the light curves that you found most interesting, so that you review at least three stars.&amp;nbsp; You can access a light curve again by clicking “Talk” at the top of the PlanetHunters classification page, and then click “Search” at the top of the TalkPlanetHunters page, enter the “Zooniverse ID” of the light curve you want to review in the textbox below “Search For”, and click “Search”.&amp;nbsp; Then your object should appear on the right.&amp;nbsp; Click on your object’s Zooniverse ID, and you will have access to &lt;em&gt;the entire Kepler light curve &lt;/em&gt;for that star.*&amp;nbsp; Note that typically you will now be presented with much more data than when you first reviewed the same star’s light curve.&amp;nbsp; Below the lightcurve, there is a label “Quarters” and a list of light curves segments (e.g., “1-1”, “1-2”, “1-3”, “2-1”, … “17-3”).&amp;nbsp; When you first reviewed the light curve, you were presented with just one of these segments. Now, you can review all the available data for the star.&amp;nbsp; Click on each of the quarters to review each segment of the light curve.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* = You can also review a list of the light curves that you analyzed by choosing “Profile” at the top of the planethunters classification page.&amp;nbsp; If you marked some light curves as a “favorite” in planethunters, then you can find those by clicking “Favorites”.&amp;nbsp; If you entered a comment about some light curves, then you can find those by clicking “Talk” at the top of the planethunters classification page and then “Profile” on the TalkPlanetHunters page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After reevaluating the interesting light curves you found, answer the following questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha;"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Which light curves do you still consider likely to contain a good transiting planet candidate?&amp;nbsp; (List their ZooinvereIDs.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What is the percentage of light curves with a good transiting planet candidate relative to the total number of light curves in your data table?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Kepler mission monitored the brightness of ~192,000 stars in search of transits and identified approximately 4,696 planet candidates. What is the rate of planet candidates per star (expressed as a percentage) based on the Kepler mission?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How does the percentage of transiting planet candidates based on your analysis compare to the frequency of planet candidates identified by the Kepler Mission?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If your % is similar, explain whether this is surprising or not, and why. If your number is different, explain why you think this is so. &amp;nbsp;In either case, list at least three possible reasons, and sort them by which are think is more significant (from most significant to least significant).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Which of the light curves above do you consider to be your “best” transiting planet candidate?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IV.&amp;nbsp; Quantitative Analysis of One Planet Candidate &amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;(30%)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, you will estimate a putative planet’s orbital period and size, based on the light curve with your best planet candidate.&amp;nbsp; If you have no good planet candidates, then you may use the star APH000067z.&amp;nbsp; You may wish to review the PlanetHunters video tutorial for tips to help you measure the transit depth and duration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha;"&gt;&lt;li&gt;What is the Zooniverse ID of the star that you are analyzing for this section?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Find two to five putative transits.&amp;nbsp; (You may need to look in multiple quarters.)&amp;nbsp; Zoom in around each and report the approximate mid-times of each transit.&amp;nbsp; Use the times on the scale at the top of the light curves.&amp;nbsp; (The times along the bottom axis reset each segment, so can’t be compared across multiple segments.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Are the times of the putative transits consistent with a single orbital period?&amp;nbsp; If so, what is the approximate orbital period?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What is the typical brightness level of the points outside of a transit?&amp;nbsp; (No units needed; brightness is in arbitrary / relative units.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What is the typical brightness level of the points inside of the transit? (again, no units needed)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What is the transit depth? The formula for depth is (transit depth) equals (out-of-transit brightness minus in-transit brightness) divided by (out-of-transit brightness).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Measure the starting time of a transit.&amp;nbsp; Measure the ending time of a transit.&amp;nbsp; Compute the transit duration.&amp;nbsp; (transit duration) = (transit end time) minus (transit start time).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If there are many transits in the same light curve, then measure the transit depth and duration for at least five transits.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Are your measurements of the depths and durations of different transits are consistent with each other?&amp;nbsp; Does this result favor or disfavor the planet hypothesis?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What is the average of your measured transit depths?&lt;br&gt;(Use this average in the calculations below.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What is the radius of the putative planet relative to the radius of the star?&lt;br&gt;The formula is (planet radius)/(star radius) = square root(transit depth).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What is the radius of the putative planet relative to the radius of the Sun?&lt;br&gt;(planet radius)/(radius of sun) = (planet radius)/(star radius) * (star radius)/(radius of sun)&lt;br&gt;For most stars, the radius of the star (divided by the radius of the sun) will be reported below the light curve, after “Radius” and above “Kepler ID”.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What is the radius of the putative planet relative to the radius of Jupiter?&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;The radius of the sun is approximately 10 times the radius of Jupiter.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Given your measurement of the planet’s radius, is the putative transiting object more likely to be a planet or eclipsing binary star?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What is the radius of the putative planet relative to the radius of Earth?&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;The radius of the sun is approximately 100 times the radius of Earth.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If this star were to have another transiting planet whose radius was equal to that of the Earth, how likely would you be have noticed the Earth-size planet’s transits?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;V.&amp;nbsp; Reflecting on the PlanetHunters Experience &lt;/strong&gt;(10%)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha;"&gt;&lt;li&gt;What did you like most about this project?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Did you encounter any specific difficulties or frustration that you can pinpoint? &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;If so, please state which specific questions or logistical aspect of the project. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Do you have any suggestions for how the project could be improved for students in a future semester?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Has this project affected your understanding of the scientific process?&amp;nbsp; If so, please explain how your perspective has changed through this project.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;PlanetHunters is just one of several citizen science projects enabled by the larger &lt;a href="https://www.zooniverse.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Zooniverse&lt;/a&gt; project that involves hundreds of thousands of individuals worldwide in meaningful scientific investigations. &amp;nbsp;This new effort is known as&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Citizens Science,&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;and Zooniverse won a major &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/giving/global-impact-awards/" target="_blank"&gt;Global Impact Award&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;from the Google corporation. &amp;nbsp;You may be interested in exploring some of &lt;a href="https://www.zooniverse.org/projects" target="_blank"&gt;their other projects&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; Based on your experience with this project, how likely are you to participate in a citizen science project outside of a formal class?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;

    <title>Assignment Deadlines &amp; Other Important Dates </title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;The table below summarizes the key deadlines for the papers and class project, as well as the date ranges (Eastern Time) when you will be required to take each of the five quizzes. &amp;nbsp;I strongly recommend that students start papers and projects well in advance, so as to smooth out the time required to do a good job. &amp;nbsp;While course grades will be based on discussion posts as of Dec 12, they will be much more valuable to students who participate in each week's discussion. &amp;nbsp;Similarly, I recommend that students&amp;nbsp;keep up with each week's readings from the textbook and course content website, rather than trying to cram many readings into&amp;nbsp;a small period of time. &amp;nbsp;

    <title>Textbook</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;Throughout the semester, you will read the online "lectures" at this website and listen to&amp;nbsp;ocassional videos. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting in Week 3, we will be reading much of the required textbook:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;An Introduction to Astrobiology&lt;/b&gt;, David A. Rothery et al. (editors), 2nd edition, 2011,Cambridge University Press, ISBN 978-1-107-60093-5 (paperback) &lt;a href="http://www.cambridge.org/9781107600935" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.cambridge.org/9781107600935&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book can be acquired from online booksellers including the &lt;a href="http://www.cambridge.org/9781107600935" target="_blank"&gt;publisher&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/introduction-to-astrobiology-david-a-rothery/1102830074" target="_blank"&gt;Barnes &amp; Noble&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/An-Introduction-Astrobiology-David-Rothery/dp/1107600936" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;nbsp;This is an excellent resource where several British scientists join together to write highly informative chapters on most aspects of our course. &amp;nbsp;The text is more detailed than the online `lectures' and students do not need to memorize or study intensively all of its contents. &amp;nbsp;But it gives lots of substantive detail underlying the issues we discuss, and is a valuable complement to the lectures. &amp;nbsp; Please be sure to have the text in hand by Week 3.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Theme I: The Astronomical Context for Life</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the first theme of&amp;nbsp;the course. There are three topics for this unit:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://courses.ed.science.psu.edu/astro140/node/490"&gt;How do we study life in the Universe&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://courses.ed.science.psu.edu/astro140/node/494"&gt;Cosmology: The History of the Universe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://courses.ed.science.psu.edu/astro140/node/498"&gt;Stars: Energy for Life&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The unit will be completed over two&amp;nbsp;weeks of the course. &amp;nbsp;Except for some historical background, this&amp;nbsp;is intended primarily to&amp;nbsp;review&amp;nbsp;material you covered in a previous introductory astronomy class, with some particular focus on ideas most relevant to the emergence of life in the Universe. &amp;nbsp;If this material is new to you, then please devote extra time to this theme. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Scientific Method</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;We are adopting here an empirical approach based on the scientific method. A good scientific theory should be consistent with previous observations or experiments, make clear and detailed (and often quantitative) predictions that are observable or testable, and the results must be reproducible by other scientists under controlled conditions. In astronomy, we often rely on the assumption (validated many many times) that the laws of physics and properties of matter are the same throughout the observable&amp;nbsp;Universe. Science rests on the philosophical assumptions that there is a real world, that our senses inform us about this external reality, and that the physical world behaves in a consistent and often comprehensible manner. &amp;nbsp;This philosophical approach is called &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positivism"&gt;Positivism&lt;/a&gt;; it dates back to Plato in ancient Greece and grew to prominence in the 18th century as Newton's mathethematical laws of physics became widely accepted. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Examples of strong arguments relating to&amp;nbsp;Life in the Universe&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;We infer the existence of habitable planets orbiting ordinary nearby stars from periodic variations in the stars' radial velocity and from the transits of the planets across the star's disk. A few of these planets are in the star's Habitable Zone where life could develop. These results are convincing because they are quantitatively interpreted using Newton's laws of gravity &amp; motion.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&amp;nbsp;We infer the existence of dozens of species of molecules in astronomical environments (molecular clouds, protoplanetary disks, comet tails, Jovian moons) which are essential to terrestrial life. This is convincing because quantum mechanics gives precise predictions regarding the emission lines of molecules.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We infer that all living organisms on Earth (bacteria, grass, bee, humans, etc) are descended from a single line of primitive organisms 3-4 Gyr (giga-year or billion years) ago. This is convincing because biochemical/cellular studies show tremendous similarity in the chemistry (DNA, proteins, metabolism) and genetic codes of organisms today, and because of interpretations of the fossil record combined with radioactive dating of rock layers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Example of a weak argument relating to&amp;nbsp;Life in the Universe&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The presence or absence of UFOs is very difficult to interpret in a convincing fashion:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pro:&lt;/strong&gt; Unidentified Flying Objects demonstrate that technologically advanced extraterrestrial living organisms are now visiting Earth. &amp;nbsp;This is unconvincing because the explanation involving alien spacecraft is only one of several possibilities (e.g.&amp;nbsp;witness mistakes or hoaxes). It would be convincing if we had some physical object from these visits that could be studied in scientific laboratories to show that the object is not from Earth.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Con:&lt;/strong&gt; The absence of clear visits from extraterrestrial civilizations demonstrates that no extraterrestrial civilizations exist in the Galaxy. This is known as Fermi's (or Tipler's) argument. &amp;nbsp;But &amp;nbsp;a general argument is made from a narrow finding. &amp;nbsp;It is possible that&amp;nbsp;extraterrestrial civilizations exist in the Galaxy today with technology that could travel to Earth, but they have not done so. &amp;nbsp;Maybe they haven't found Earth (lots of other nice habitable planets for vacations!) or have chosen not to visit for some unknown reason.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, while the astronomical evidence for habitable exoplanets orbiting other stars is quite convincing from a scientific viewpoint (even though the findings are quite recent), the various arguments cooncerning Unidentified Flying Objects are not very convincing in one direction or the other. &amp;nbsp;This is the kind of judgments we will seek during the course, particular in the Papers and Discussion. &amp;nbsp;Note that scientific arguments are not black-and-white. (In contrast, mathematical arguments can be absolutely right or wrong; for example, 2+2=5 is wrong). Science progresses by preponderance of evidence, confirmation and contradiction of predictions -- not logical proof. Thus, scientific conclusions at any given time can be wrong, particularly at the frontiers of knowledge. Scientific conclusions are not comprehensive and complete; there are many important questions which have not been successfully approached using the scientific method. On the examples above, we have not disproved the hypothesis "UFOs are from outer space" just because the evidence to date is unconvincing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;But collectively and over time, the powerful growth of mutually supporting scientific evidence and theories convinces large communities of scholars that we are on the right track of understanding the universe around us. We thus see progress from scientific knowledge to scientific understanding. As we gain understanding of different aspects of the universe, we also gain the ability to manipulate the physical world to our advantage. This leads to modern technologies: automobiles and jet airplanes, electricity and the Internet, medicines to treat diseases, and so forth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;During this course, we will be discussing issues where scientific knowledge and understanding is relevant to the question of Life in the Universe:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li style="text-align: left;"&gt;cosmology and structures in the universe&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li style="text-align: left;"&gt;production of chemical elements and molecules in the Galaxy&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li style="text-align: left;"&gt;formation and evolution of planets orbiting stars&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li style="text-align: left;"&gt;concepts of habitability on planets&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li style="text-align: left;"&gt;origin of life on planets&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li style="text-align: left;"&gt;interrelationships between life and planetary atmospheres&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li style="text-align: left;"&gt;possibilities of intelligent life on other planets&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;Some of this understanding is well-established (e.g. cosmology, synthesis of elements in stars), some is at the forefront of current research (e.g. formation of planets, life-atmosphere interrelationships), and some still have very little evidence and knowledge (e.g. origin of life, intelligent extraterrestrial life).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;You can find some related discussions of the scientific method in the following material:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060526174713/http://pasadena.wr.usgs.gov/office/ganderson/es10/lectures/lecture01/lecture01.html" target="_blank"&gt;Earth Sciences 10, Lecture 1: Scientific Method&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.geo.sunysb.edu/esp/files/scientific-method.html" target="_blank"&gt;An Introduction to Science:&amp;nbsp;Scientific Thinking and the Scientific Method&amp;nbsp;by&amp;nbsp;Steven D. Schafersman&amp;nbsp;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://teacher.nsrl.rochester.edu/phy_labs/appendixe/appendixe.html" target="_blank"&gt;APPENDIX E: Introduction to the Scientific Method&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Part of the method is amusingly presented in the 1-minute video "&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b240PGCMwV0" target="_blank"&gt;The Key to Science&lt;/a&gt;" by distinguished physicist Richard Feynman (Caltech) decades ago. &amp;nbsp;A more modern and nuanced view of the scientific method, taking into account&amp;nbsp;sociological aspects of the scientific community, is given in a 19-minute&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/naomi_oreskes_why_we_should_believe_in_science?language=en" target="_blank"&gt;TED talk by historian Naomi Oreskes &lt;/a&gt; (Harvard). Please see both of these videos.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    <title>The Rise of Modern Science</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;Modern science began roughly 400 years ago in Europe with study of phenomena around us: study of the forces regulating the interaction of objects (physics), study of the composition of objects (chemistry), and study of living organisms (biology). Modern scientific theories, observations and experiments build upon themselves, creating an amazing edifice of knowledge and understanding. In many cases, we use our knowledge and understanding to build advanced devices that allow further discovery of phenomena and testing of theory. For example, we use our knowledge of light, optics, electronics, materials and spacecraft to construct superb telescopes that can see billions of times fainter than the human eye, and at wavelengths we can&amp;#39;t see at all. We use our understanding of thermodynamics, gases, materials, and the chemistry of combustion to design jet airplanes that fly us around the world. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Physical processes for many situations were found to have an underpinning in advanced mathematics (calculus, differential equations, group theory, differential geometry). We (or at least, I) really don&amp;#39;t know why the Universe is regulated by mathematical laws of physics. &amp;nbsp;Here are a few of the major advances in the the emergence of modern science:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;In the late-1600s, Isaac Newton derived differential equations that explain the motions and mechanics of interacting bodies (for instance, the motion of a kicked football or the motion of the Moon around the Earth)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;In the late-1800s, Ludwig Boltzmann and others generalized these equations to explain the behaviors of fluids, gasses and stars. This includes thermodynamics, fluid mechanics, stellar systems, and so forth.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;During the 1700-1900s, chemists found that matter is composed of combinations of ~100 elements: hydrogen, helium, carbon, iron, and so forth. Their properties could be organized in the Periodic Table of the Elements. &amp;nbsp;Browse the interactive &lt;a href="http://www.ptable.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Periodic Table of the Elements&lt;/a&gt;. The most important elements for living organisms on Earth are hydrogen (H), carbon (C], oxygen (O), and nitrogen (N). Our bodies also have phosphorus (P] in our DNA, calcium (Ca) in our bones, iron (Fe) in our blood, and small amounts of other elements.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;In the early-1900s, many physicists found that behaviors within atoms are quantized; that is, only specific energies are permitted. Quantum mechanics provided a profound explanation for the periodic table of the elements, atomic and molecular spectra, and much more.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;In the late-1900s, biochemists and cell biologists recognized that a complicated polymer known as DNA carries the genetic information in living organisms that provides a code for the production of proteins and for passing that information on to offspring.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;In the late-1900s and early 2000s, particle physicists established the foundations of matter in the form of quarks and other elementary particles, including the Higgs boson discovered in 2013. These are understood within a theory based on quantum mechanics.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;From the early-1990s to the present, astronomers have established that the universe is expanding from a `Big Bang&amp;#39; event ~14 Gyr ago. &amp;nbsp;The theory is well-established and agrees well with diverse datasets, but implies that the Universe is filled with Dark Matter and Dark Energy which we have not detected in the laboratory. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>Historical Views on Life in the Universe</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;Since the beginning of western culture, scholars have discussed the possibility that we are not alone in the Universe. For centuries, this was the domain of natural philosophers and theologians who discussed the issues based on abstract philosophical and religious ideas. Even astronomers who addressed the matter (e.g. Christiaan Huygens and William&amp;nbsp;Herschel in the 18th century) engaged in fantastical thinking not supported by their observations. In modern times, the popularity of `science fiction' involving aliens from outer space reveals that the issue still has high cultural interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, starting around the 1970s (e.g., Carl Sagan, Frank Drake, Lynn Margulis), these discussions began to be rooted in empirical findings of astronomy, planetary science, chemistry, and biology. It is not longer fantastic to discuss the possibility of extraterrestrial life. Our course will take this modern approach to the subject, but it is valuable to recognize the historical background. The information below is in outline form, but you are encouraged to learn more about these historical figures and ideas through the Web links.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Greek/Roman Era (500BC - 400AD) Arguments Both Against and in Favor of Extraterrestrial Life&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li style="text-align: left;"&gt;Plato &amp; Aristotle's &lt;a href="http://galileo.rice.edu/images/things/ptolematic_universe.gif" target="_blank"&gt;geocentric universe&lt;/a&gt;: the celestial bodies are totally different from our earthly world

&lt;h2 style="text-align: left;"&gt;Christian Era (500-1500) Strong Prohibition against Extraterrestrial Life&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li style="text-align: left;"&gt;Aristotlean science incorporated into Christian theology (&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamics_of_the_celestial_spheres" target="_blank"&gt;angels/seraphim ~ heavenly spheres&lt;/a&gt;). E.g. in Dante's &lt;a href="http://www.divinecomedy.org/divine_comedy.html" target="_blank"&gt;Divine Comedy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li style="text-align: left;"&gt;God created Heaven, Earth and &amp; Man (&lt;a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/1-1.htm" target="_blank"&gt;Book of Genesis&lt;/a&gt;, ancient Hebrew creation story). Man lies between beasts and angels (&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_chain_of_being" target="_blank"&gt;Chain of Being&lt;/a&gt;). Life on Earth has unique relationship to God and cannot exist elsewhere.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 style="text-align: left;"&gt;Age of Enlightment (1500-1900) Great Popularity of Extraterrestrial Life&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://galileo.rice.edu/bio/narrative_6.html" target="_blank"&gt;Galileo's telescope&lt;/a&gt; (new moons/planets/stars), &lt;a href="http://csep10.phys.utk.edu/astr161/lect/history/newton3laws.html" target="_blank"&gt;Newton's laws&lt;/a&gt; imply that the mechanics of the celestial bodies (e.g. Moon (celestial mechanics) are not different from the mechanics of our terrestrial world.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.webelements.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Chemical elements&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.universetoday.com/53563/who-discovered-helium/" target="_blank"&gt;discovery of "atoms" on Earth and in stellar spectra&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li style="text-align: left;"&gt;Plurality of worlds very popular. Scholars write about Venusians, Lunar Cities, Martian canals. Examples include: Bernard de Fontenelle's &lt;a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=VGoFAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=Fontenelle+Bernard+inauthor:Fontenelle#v=onepage&amp;q=Fontenelle%20Bernard%20inauthor%3AFontenelle&amp;f=false" target="_blank"&gt;Conversations on the Plurality of Worlds&lt;/a&gt; (1686, popular book among the nobles of France under Louis XIV) and Christiaan Huygens'&amp;nbsp;Cosmotheoros&amp;nbsp;(1698, book on human-like beings on Moon and the planets by a famous astronomer)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 style="text-align: left;"&gt;Three Illustrative Quotes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;"The Marchioness was very impatient to know what the fixed stars were. Are the inhabited, like the planets [in our Solar System]? said she, or are they not peopled. … The neighboring worlds sometimes send us visitors, who come, in a very magnificent style. These visitors are comets, ornamented with brilliant flowing hard, a venerable beard, or a majestic train" (&lt;a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=VGoFAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=Fontenelle+Bernard+inauthor:Fontenelle#v=onepage&amp;q=Fontenelle%20Bernard%20inauthor%3AFontenelle&amp;f=false" target="_blank"&gt;de Fontenelle 1686, p.110 &amp; 121&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;"What a wonderful and amazing Scheme have we here of the magnificent Vastness of the Universe! So many Suns, so many Earths, and every one of them stockd with so many Herbs, Trees and Animals, and adornd with so many Seas and Mountains!" (Huygens 1698)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;"... the knowledge of the construction of the Moon leads us insensibly to several consequences... such as the great probability, not to say almost absolute certainty, of her being inhabited." (William Herschel 1780, famous astronomer, discoverer of Uranus using Newton's laws)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 style="text-align: left;"&gt;Modern Era (1900--) Arguments Both Against and in Favor of Extraterrestrial Life&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Skepticism about life outside Earth (review&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://tal.forum2.org/rare" target="_blank"&gt;Rare Earth hypothesis&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li style="text-align: left;"&gt;Temperatures, atmospheres in most planets are inhospitable&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li style="text-align: left;"&gt;Failure to make 'life in the test tube' or find life on Moon/Mars&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li style="text-align: left;"&gt;Simple life (e.g. bacteria) may be common but complex life (e.g. humans) may be rare&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li style="text-align: left;"&gt;No evidence for extraterrestrial life yet&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Illustrative Quote&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"... how totally unfitted are all the other planets [in our Solar System] either to develop or to preserve the higher forms of life, and in most cases, any above the lowest and most rudimentary. ... Mars receives less than half the amount of sun-heat per unit surface that we do. And as it is almost certain that it contains no water ... man's place in the solar system is altogether unique, and that no other planet either has developed or can develop such a full and complete life." (evolutionist A. R. Wallace, 1903)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;vs. scientific optimism about extraterrestrial life:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li style="text-align: left;"&gt;biochemistry is an extension of astrochemistry: emergence of life a natural phenomenon.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li style="text-align: left;"&gt;development of rocketry: travel to the planets achieved, travel to stars conceivable&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li style="text-align: left;"&gt;Mars does have water, frozen today in polar caps but flowing as a liquid in the past&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li style="text-align: left;"&gt;scientific search for extraterrestrial life in the Solar System&amp;nbsp;begins (1970s--)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li style="text-align: left;"&gt;search for extraterrestrial radio signals (SETI) proceeds but unsuccessful (1960s--)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li style="text-align: left;"&gt;Carl Sagan, astronomer and popular proponent of searching for extraterrestrial life (1970-80s)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li style="text-align: left;"&gt;discovery of extrasolar planets successful (1990s--)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li style="text-align: left;"&gt;NASA promotes astrobiology &amp; related initiatives (1990s--)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example:&lt;/strong&gt; This course and our textbook on astrobiology&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

    <title>Cosmology: The History of the Universe</title>
    <body>&lt;div class="art-postcontent"&gt;&lt;div class="art-article"&gt;&lt;p&gt;We first lay the foundations of Life in the Universe by discussing the Universe as a whole, its origins in a Big Bang ~14&amp;nbsp;billion years ago, and its history until the present day. Big Bang cosmology began in the early-20th century, was largely confirmed by the late-20th century, and is now in an era of detailed investigation, establishing the parameters of the model to ~1% precision. &amp;nbsp;Modern cosmology is full of unexpected and unintuitive features: a universal expansion (similar to blowing up a balloon); its contents dominated by mysterious Dark Matter and Dark Energy; a clear explanation for the formation of the simplest elements (hydrogen and helium), and the formation of stars and galaxies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We then proceed to discuss galaxies that form from the matter in the expanding Universe, and our Milky Way Galaxy in particular. &amp;nbsp;It has billions of stars, but also an `interstellar medium' of gas and solid particles from which later stars and planets form. &amp;nbsp;So this lays the astronomical foundations for the existence of planets and chemical ingredients needed for life. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All societies have a cosmology … an explanation for the origin and development of the world around us. In many traditional cultures, the world is created by deities, gods and goddesses. The previous lecture outlined the rise of modern science, starting with Isaac Newton's mathematical relationships defining the motions and gravitational interactions of physical objects. &amp;nbsp;So our cosmology is based on modern scientific theories (gravity, atomic &amp; molecular physics, etc) that has been completely validated in the laboratory and in technologies. &amp;nbsp;This is the first cosmology that is `true' in an empirical sense, not based on beliefs or speculations. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>The Big Bang Universe</title>
    <body>&lt;h2&gt;The expanding Universe&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the 1920s, the astronomer Edwin Hubble (shown below left) and others &amp;nbsp;obtained spectra of these galaxies to measure their motions towards or away from us based on the Doppler shift. To everyone's amazement, nearly all galaxies showed a redshift indicating they are all moving away from us. Furthermore, the redshift is greater for more distant galaxies, following a linear relationship v = H&lt;sub style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; "&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;d (Hubble's law). Hubble's original data is shown below right; today we have millions of galaxy redshifts measured, extending the diagram to fainter magnitudes (rightward) and faster velocities (upward). &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The only reasonable interpretation for all galaxies moving away from us in a linear fashion is that space itself is expanding, much like the rubber surface on a balloon expands as it is inflated. &amp;nbsp;By the middle of the 20th century, nearly all astronomers acknowledged that we reside in an expanding universe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; "&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=1828|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__lightboxed]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; "&gt;A powerful explanation of the expanding universe actually preceded the observations. &amp;nbsp;A brilliant young scientist named&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.aip.org/history/einstein/" style="color: rgb(2, 122, 198); text-decoration: none; " target="_blank"&gt;Albert Einstein&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;had made profound changes to Newtonian physics. First, in 1905, he showed that Newton's laws of motion do not hold when speeds approach the speed of light. He then struggled for a decade to understand gravity in this new context, emerging with the theory of General Relativity in 1915. Based on the view that massive bodies alter the geometry of 3-dimensional space-time, Einstein's General Relativity gives a full and accurate explanation of the gravitational attraction between bodies. The mathematics was quickly applied to the universe by others who&amp;nbsp;found that the theory predicts that the Universe should not be static: it should either expand or contract following specific mathematical formulae. Remember that this is not a vague idea, but a rigorous&amp;nbsp;mathematical derivation&amp;nbsp;based on Einstein's General Relativity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; "&gt;Below are predictions of the theory of General Relativity for different model parameter values. &amp;nbsp;The orange curve represents a `closed' Universe where the expansion stops and reverses to a contraction due to a high density of matter (Omega_m). &amp;nbsp;Curves above the green line represent an `open' Universe that expand forever. &amp;nbsp;Observations of the masses of galaxies (including the mysterious Dark Matter) indicate that our Universe has Omega_m around 0.3 ... so our Universe will expand forever. &amp;nbsp;But since 1999, very convincing evidence has been acquired that the universal expansion is actually accelerating, as in the red curve. &amp;nbsp;The cause is another mysterious component of the Universe (denoted Omega_V here) called Dark Energy, a repulsive force in space-time itself. &amp;nbsp;The nature of Dark Matter (which gives an attractive force) and Dark Energy (which gives a repulsive force) are not understood today, but we are convinced they exist. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

Extrapolating to earlier times, there must be some instant when the expansion began, after which the density of the universe was extremely high. High densities imply high temperatures for normal matter. When dense matter is hot it radiates light with a `blackbody' spectrum. So the expanding universe model predicts:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

They were working for Bell Laboratories (the U.S. telephone company) to investigate why static was present on long-distance telephone calls that used microwave signals. They found that the entire sky was the source of the radiation. &amp;nbsp;The discovery of the CMB was a powerful confirmation of the Big Bang model for the expanding universe.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The birth of galaxies&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though the Universe has been expanding since the Big Bang, dispersing the atoms and cooling the light, gravity is still present. On local scales, atoms attracted each other, forming early stars and then galaxies. We have little observational knowledge about this phase of the Universe's history, hence its nickname `the Dark Ages'. It lasted roughly from 1 million to 1 billion years after the Big Bang, or the first few percent of the Universe's current age. Astrophysicists argue that an early generation of stars formed during this time, quickly going supernova and polluting the gas with small amounts of elements heavier than helium. Detailed models show that gravitational attraction (involving both Dark Matter and regular matter) produced dense sheets and filaments that then collapsed to form galaxies and galaxy clusters. Big galaxies cannibalize smaller ones, and mergers of big galaxies are common. Massive black holes formed at the center of most galaxies at the same time.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Astrophysicists have taking the known laws of physics (gravitational attraction, gas dynamics) with the conditions emerging from the Big Bang to produce computer simulations of the formation of galaxies as the Universe expands and cools. These simulations are among the largest scientific calculations ever made. See this excellent 4-minute &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SY0bKE10ZDM"&gt;YouTube video&lt;/a&gt; for a tour of the 2013 &lt;a href="http://www.illustris-project.org"&gt; Illustris simulation&lt;/a&gt;, one of the most recent and comprehensive efforts.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    <title>Galaxies and the Milky Way Galaxy</title>

&lt;p&gt;In the early 20th century, astronomers knew only about stars relatively near the Sun in the Milky Way. But there were some blurry objects in the sky known as `nebulae'. Around 1920, the talented American astronomer &lt;a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/aso/databank/entries/bahubb.html" style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; color: rgb(0, 77, 150); text-decoration: none; " target="_blank"&gt;Edwin Hubble&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;used a large new telescope in California to obtain improved photographs of the nebulae. Some appeared to be huge, but very distant, structures similar to the Milky Way. With repeated observations of the nebula Messier 31 in the Andromeda constellation, Hubble demonstrated it was a distinct "island universe," or galaxy. He and others photographed many other galaxies. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; "&gt;The first two galaxy images shown below are seen nearly face-on, showing the spiral arm structure where stars are forming today. &amp;nbsp;The third image shows a spiral galaxy seen edge-on. Note the dark clouds of interstellar medium that obscure the flat disk. &amp;nbsp;While galaxy collisions still occur today, ~14 billion years after the violent Dark Ages, most galaxies are quiet and stable, serenely spinning through space.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

Because the Sun lies in the disk of our Galaxy, we cannot see its structure as we can with distant face-on galaxies. &amp;nbsp;But recent images of the full sky have shows that our galaxy is very similar to other spiral galaxies. &amp;nbsp;The first photo below is an all-sky composite of our Galaxy as seen from Earth. &amp;nbsp;Note the similarity to the edge-on spiral shows above. &amp;nbsp;The second image below is obtained at infrared wavelengths of light where the obscuring clouds have little effect. &amp;nbsp;The final image below is a recent artist's drawing, consistent with modern observations, showing our Galaxy &amp;nbsp;as it would appear if seen face-on. &amp;nbsp;Note the Sun is about 25,000 light-years (8000 parsecs) from the center, and lies between two spiral arms. The central region of the Galaxy has a large bar, and a modest 3x10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;M&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;massive black hole lies at the very core.&lt;/p&gt;
[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=1845|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__lightboxed]
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; [ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=1846|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__lightboxed]
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; [ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=1847|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__lightboxed]
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Astronomers study star and planet formation in the closest spiral arms which do not suffer too much obscuration from interstellar clouds and are nearby so that small and faint structures can be detected. &amp;nbsp;For example, a major nusery of young stars near the Sun is the Orion Nebula in the Orion Nebula Cloud, which likes in the Orion Spur shown in the above diagram. &amp;nbsp;It is only ~400 pc (parsecs, 1 pc ~ 3 light-years ~ 3x10&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt; meters) away, much closer than the Galactic Center at a distance around 8,000 pc. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</body>

    <title>The Interstellar Medium and Molecules</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;The images of the Milky Way Galaxy and other galaxies shown on the previous page were mostly made in visible light, the waveband where the surfaces of stars shine. Their temperatures are thousands of degrees Kelvin (above absolute zero). But the dark clouds where stars and planets form are much colder, only tens or hundreds of degrees Kelvin. These `shine' in the microwave and infrared bands of light, and in particular exhibit the emission lines and bands produced by particular molecules.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; "&gt;The interstellar medium has two major components, gas and `dust'. &amp;nbsp;The gas is mostly hydrogen and helium (H and He) produced in the Big Bang, with elements like carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, silicon, iron &amp;nbsp;(C, O, N, Si, Fe) and other elements produced in red giants. &amp;nbsp;(We will discuss this next week.) &amp;nbsp;In the cold clouds, these atoms are in the form of molecules such as H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O (water), CO (carbon monoxide), CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (carbon dioxide), and dozens of other molecules. &amp;nbsp;The `interstellar dust' component is poorly named; it is mostly tiny powder-like particles of rock, such as SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (silicon dioxide, called `quartz' when found in Earth rock). &amp;nbsp; There are also tiny solid particles of carbon resembling the black soot that comes out of combustion on Earth (e.g. a burning candle or log).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

A few stars (probably with planets) are forming now in these pillars. Orion recently (about 1-2 million years ago) formed a rich cluster of stars (probably with planets). The dark cloud is behind the cluster, and the edge is brightly shining due to heating by the hottest Orion stars.[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=1550|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__left]&lt;/p&gt;

The number of protons defines the element: 1 = hydrogen (H), 2 = helium (He), …, 6 = carbon (C), 7 = nitrogen (N), 8 = oxygen (O), …, 26 = iron (Fe), and so on.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;If you don't know or have forgotten the symbols for the elements, see a Periodic Table of Elements&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.webelements.com/" style="color: rgb(2, 122, 198); text-decoration: none; " target="_blank"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;A collection of atoms can be called a gas cloud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; "&gt;When the cloud is hot, two atoms that collide will bounce off each other because the electron clouds (both negatively charges) repel each other. But when a cloud is cold and the collisions are slow and the two atoms can form a weak, but stable, bond. This occurs when the attraction of the protons is slightly stronger than the repulsion of the electrons. These entity of two or more atoms bonded together is called a `molecule'. `Chemistry' is the science devoted to the behavior and reactions between molecules. &amp;nbsp;Below are two diagrams of the water molecule, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; "&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=1853|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__lightboxed]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

They can stretch and bend in various ways (see fun&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_vibration" style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; color: rgb(0, 77, 150); text-decoration: none; " target="_blank"&gt;moving diagrams&lt;/a&gt;). Even at very cold temperatures, the molecules can rotate. But the behavior of atoms and molecules is not like the behavior of large objects we experience in our daily lives. Large objects can move in a smooth fashion where any energy is possible. But tiny objects follow the rules of `quantum mechanics' and can be in only a fixed number of distinct energy states. A rotating or vibrating molecule can change its energy state by emitting or absorbing a particular wavelength of light. These wavelengths are generally not in the visible band, but have longer wavelengths in the infrared and microwave bands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; "&gt;Thus, astronomers can observe the sky using specialized telescopes and look for emission or absorption lines at particular wavelengths associated with the quantum transitions of specific molecules. Even for simple molecules, these patterns of spectral lines can be very complicated, often blurring together to form messy bands. But they are unique for each molecule: just as a crime investigator can identify a person from a unique fingerprint, an astronomer can identify a molecule from its unique pattern of microwave and infrared emission lines. The study of the spectral lines and patterns produced by different molecules is called "molecular spectroscopy."&lt;/p&gt;

To show why this is relevant to our search for live in the universe, we show the infrared spectra of three familiar planets in our Solar System. We see that Venus, Earth and Mars all have carbon dioxide in their atmospheres, but only Earth has abundant water and oxygen (inferred from it chemical byproduct, O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; or ozone).&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Stars: Energy for Life</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;On Earth, scientists study the complicated interactions in the world around us, often tracing `cycles' that show how some feature begins, develops, and ends. Some involve physical components (such as the `water cycle': evaporation from oceans, rain and rivers flow back to oceans, some is captures in ice caps) while others involve living organisms (such as the life cycle of a human from birth through childhood, adulthood, aging and death). Similarly, astronomers can trace the physical cycles and interactions in a Galaxy, and of its components (such as the interstellar medium, stars and planets). Here we discuss the life cycle of individual stars. Stars are crucial for life in the universe:&amp;nbsp;without the chemical elements they produce, planets would be made only of gases; and without&amp;nbsp;their heat, planets would be too cold to sustain life.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Star Formation</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;We have seen that, in a spiral galaxy like the Milky Way, a complicated "interstellar medium" resides in the space between stars. It consists of gases (mostly hydrogen and helium from the Big Bang, with a soup of interesting molecules) and tiny solid "dust grains" (some made of rock like tiny sand grains, others made of carbon like soot). &amp;nbsp;We see it best in illuminated clouds like in the &lt;a href="https://media.ed.science.psu.edu/content/orion-nebula"&gt;Orion Nebula&lt;/a&gt; or&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://media.ed.science.psu.edu/content/eagle-nebula-cloud"&gt;Eagle Nebula&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;nbsp;As a spiral arm passes through a region in the Galaxy, the interstellar material is compressed and dark cold clouds form. When a cloud of interstellar medium is dense enough, gravity locally dominates other forces and a star forms by `gravitational collapse'. Material with too much spin forms a flattened disk orbiting the protostar; this is the "protoplanetary disk" where planets form. The star and disk formation process is complicated, and astrophysical modeling is underway. Thus stars, planets, and any life on these planets inherit their molecules from the interstellar medium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Look at the recent&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.astro.ex.ac.uk/people/mbate/Cluster/pr.html" style="color: rgb(2, 122, 198); text-decoration: none; " target="_blank"&gt;computer simulations of the star formation process&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;in a small interstellar cloud by Matthew Bate. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Bate's simulations, the gas in the cloud starts off with random swirling motions known as &lt;strong&gt;turbulence&lt;/strong&gt;. Then some clumps undergo gravitational collapse forming stars (white dots), but gas in filaments continue to fall into central concentrations of gas. Some stars form in isolation with their disks, but many interact with other young stars and disks in complex ways. A large fraction of stars remain in binary systems. Many stars form in large molecular clouds where hundreds or thousands of stars form together as a &lt;a href="http://www.astro.ex.ac.uk/people/mbate/Cluster/Animations/ClusterXT1810Z_H264B_s.mov" target="_blank"&gt;star cluster&lt;/a&gt;. Here, too, individual stars often have these&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;protoplanetary disks&lt;/strong&gt;. We will study protoplanetary disks later in the course to understand how diverse types of planetary systems form; this is needed to evaluate how many planets could harbor life similar to Earth's.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The central points are that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;stars form by gravitational collapse in molecular clouds which pervade the thin disk of the Galaxy; and&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;due to the turbulence in the clouds, disks of interstellar gas and dust orbit the protostars, and these protoplanetary disks are the site of planet formation. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</body>

    <title>Stellar Evolution</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;Once formed in a molecular cloud, the individual star goes through four major phases of evolution:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;a brief &lt;strong&gt;pre-main sequence&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;phase powered by release of energy from the gravitational collapse;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;a long-lived &lt;strong&gt;main sequence&lt;/strong&gt; phase powered by fusion of hydrogen to helium in the core;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;the &lt;strong&gt;red giant phase&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;powered by fusion of helium to elements up to iron;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;death processes—the outer layers of the red giant stars are ejected, slowly or violently, and the inner core becomes one of three types of compact star (&lt;strong&gt;white dwarf&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;neutron star&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;or &lt;strong&gt;black hole&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The observational evidence for the evolution of a star is often shown on the Hertzsprung-Russell (H-R) diagram. Here we plot the luminosity of the star on the vertical axis (actually, the log of the luminosity since the range of luminosities is so huge), and the surface temperature on the horizontal axis. Recall that &lt;strong&gt;luminosity&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;has units of energy per second, and measures the intrinsic light output or "power" of a star. A common unit of luminosity is the `watt'; we might have a 60-watt lightbulb in our room, while the Sun today emits 4x10&lt;sup&gt;27&lt;/sup&gt; watts. &amp;nbsp;We designate one solar luminosity as 1 L&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;. &amp;nbsp;Below is the best available HR diagram, obtained with the Hipparcos satellite a decade ago. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/_legacy/astro140/H-R_diagram_-edited-3.gif" style="width: 473px; height: 531px; "&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A protostar in a molecular cloud has a relatively cool surface but is quite luminous, and thus appears in the upper-right part of the H-R diagram. It quickly (not too quickly… for a 1 M&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; star like the Sun, in ~10 million years) loses power but heats its surface, moving downward and to the left on the diagram below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/_legacy/astro140/PMS_evolution_tracks.svg" style="width: 330px; height: 468px; "&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the star reaches the main sequence where the core temperature exceeds ~13 million degrees Kelvin, nuclear reactions begin in the core that fuse hydrogen to helium. In most stars, this is through the "proton-proton chain" with intermediary steps involving rare isotopes of hydrogen and helium. As over 70% of the star is hydrogen, there is a vast supply of fuel for this reaction, keeping stars on the main sequence for (in most cases) billions of years. This is the most stable and long-lived phase of stellar evolution. Our Sun today has been on the main sequence for 4.5 billion years, and will continue hydrogen-to-helium burning steadily for ~6 billion years more. Below is an artist's conception of the interior of the Sun and many other similar main sequence stars. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Red Giants:  &#039;We are Starstuff&#039;</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;The red giant phase is particularly important for understanding the origin of elements needed for planets and living organisms. When hydrogen is depleted in the core of the main sequence star (that is, when the core is entirely helium), nuclear burning continues in a shell around the core. When the core reaches ~120 million degrees Kelvin, then helium is not longer stable and can react with itself to form heavier elements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, the helium flash initiates the reaction&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;3 &lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;He ---&gt; &lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;C + 2 gamma-rays&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stars like the Sun will then burn hydrogen to helium in a shell around the core where helium is burning to carbon. &amp;nbsp;The star becomes very luminous but the outer layers swell to huge radii and cool. &amp;nbsp;The star thus moves upward and to the right in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. &amp;nbsp;The yellow curve in the H-R diagram below, labeled `1' for one solar mass (1 M&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/_legacy/astro140/690px-Stellar_evolutionary_tracks.png" style="width: 490px; height: 426px; "&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cores of more massive stars (5-100 M&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;) will be hot enough to burn carbon and other elements up to iron:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;C + &lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;He ---&gt; &lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;br&gt;
		&lt;br&gt;
		&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;O + &lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;He ---&gt; &lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt;Ne&lt;br&gt;
		&lt;br&gt;
		and similar reactions give &lt;sup&gt;24&lt;/sup&gt;Mg, &lt;sup&gt;28&lt;/sup&gt;Si, &lt;sup&gt;32&lt;/sup&gt;S, ..., &lt;sup&gt;56&lt;/sup&gt;Fe (iron).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These rare high-mass stars become supergiants, the most luminous stars in the Galaxy, during their brief red giant phases. Several nuclear reactions can occur simultaneously in the core and shells around the core (like layers of an onion; see diagram below). Each nuclear reaction releases more energy, so the stars becomes more and more luminous. These are the massive supergiants with luminosities L ~ 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;-10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; L&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/_legacy/astro140/Nucleosynthesis_in_a_star.gif" rel="lightbox[][Hertzsprung-Russell diagram of the evolution of the Sun after the main sequence.]" style="color: rgb(0, 98, 160); text-decoration: underline; "&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/_legacy/astro140/Nucleosynthesis_in_a_star.gif" style="border-top-style: none; border-right-style: none; border-bottom-style: none; border-left-style: none; border-width: initial; border-color: initial; cursor: default; border-width: initial; border-color: initial; width: 688px; height: 535px; "&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iron is the last element that can be made in this fashion because it is the most stable nucleus.&amp;nbsp; That is, any nuclear reaction involving iron requires more enegy than it emits.&amp;nbsp; Iron is thus the end-product of normal stellar nucleosynthesis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The synthesis of nuclei in red giants/supergiants explains the relative abundances of different elements in the Universe.&amp;nbsp; The plot below shows that, after hydrogen &amp;&amp;nbsp;helium, the most abundant elements in the Sun are the even-numbered elements between 6 and 26 protons: C, O, Ne, Mg, ... Fe. &amp;nbsp;The odd-numbered elements are rarer. &amp;nbsp;Note also the rarity of elements heavier than iron; these heavy elements (like lead, gold and uranium) are formed only in the rare supernova explosions of the most massive supergiants. Similar abundances of the elements are seen in other stars, the Galaxy's interstellar medium, Jupiter and elsewhere. This universal pattern is powerful evidence for the theory of red giant stars, and implies that red giants are the main source of elements with 6-26 protons in the Universe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/_legacy/astro140/elements.jpg" rel="lightbox[][Plot of the relative abundances of the elements in the Universe today.  H and He come from the Big Bang, C through Fe are produced in red giant stars, and the rare heavy elements come from supernova explosions.]"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/_legacy/astro140/1000px-SolarSystemAbundances.svg_.png" style="width: 800px; height: 360px; "&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do these atoms formed inside red giant stars get out into the Galaxy? Convection (like boiling) in red giants brings these heavier elements produced in the interior to the surface. There they condense into tiny solid particles of rock (typically Mg-Si-O mixtures) and carbon which are pushed outward into space by the starlight. These explain the &lt;strong&gt;interstellar dust particles&lt;/strong&gt;, which scatter and redden light in the Milky Way. &amp;nbsp;Later, the gas and dust ejected by red giant stars enter cold molecular clouds, where it undergoes gravitational collapse and forms new stars and planets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, the Earth, you and I are composed of C/N/O/Si/Fe/... atoms that were created in red giant stars before our solar system was born.&amp;nbsp;The atoms were formed by nuclear reactions in the giant/supergiant phase, ejected into the interstellar medium in both gaseous and solid form, and later incorporated into the solar system, the biosphere and ourselves. &amp;nbsp;The link between living organisms and red giant stars led Carl Sagan, the famous astronomer of the 1980-90s, to declare:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"We are made of starstuff." (Carl Sagan)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Summary: The Astronomical Context for Life</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;In this introductory portion of the course, we have found that normal galaxies, forming billions of years ago after the Big Bang, form stars and planets continuously from their interstellar medium. The stars produce elements heavier than helium by nuclear fusion, and these atoms are ejected into the galaxy&amp;#39;s interstellar medium. More stars and planets form in the cold interstellar clouds, now enriched with atoms from the furnaces in stars. We thus see a `cycle&amp;#39; in the Galaxy, from stars to red giants which have winds and supernovae that enrich the interstellar medium the heavy elements, which then make more stars and planets. &amp;nbsp;Planets, and life, are thus the result of the long `cycle&amp;#39; of chemical enrichment the the Galaxy ... there could not be any planets right after the Big Bant, only billions of years later. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These heavier atoms combined to form a wide variety of molecules, many containing carbon.&amp;nbsp;Interstellar clouds can be viewed as a laboratory of organic molecules diluted in the dominant hydrogen (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and helium from the Big Bang. These chemicals are familiar to us -- water, molecules in Earth&amp;#39;s atmosphere (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), methane and other hydrocarbons, alcohols and sugars. These are the molecules we see in our daily lives on the surface of Earth, the same molecules necessary for living organisms on Earth. &amp;nbsp;Thus life, like planets, are the result of the repeated cycle of star formation and death in the galaxy. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We thus have traced profound links between the Universe, the galaxies, the stars, the interstellar medium, star and planet formation, and life on Earth. While some of this story was known ~50 years ago and Carl Sagan outlined it for the public ~30 years ago, many of the findings are very recent. Understanding the molecular universe, in particular, is a strong motivation for the most modern (and expensive) telescopes of the past ~10 years such as the infrared detecting Spitzer and Herschel Space Telescopes launched into space, and the ALMA millimeter telescope in Chile.&lt;/p&gt;</body>

    <title>Theme II Life on Earth</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;Week&amp;nbsp;3&amp;nbsp;treats the chemical foundations, origin and evolution of living organisms on Earth. Our coverage is necessarily brief...these are huge fields of biochemistry, cell biology, and evolutionary biology. But our text&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;An Introduction to Astrobiology&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;has an excellent Chapter 1 that presents much of the needed material in a compact, but well-written fashion. &amp;nbsp;The&amp;nbsp;lectures in the following pages&amp;nbsp;below emphasize some of the text's topics and introduces a few new ideas. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Week 4 proceeds with some topics on terrestrial life. &amp;nbsp;Perhaps the most important topic&amp;nbsp;is the interactions between dominant living organisms and the planet's atmosphere: consumption of carbon dioxide and production of oxygen by micro-organisms and plants with&amp;nbsp;photosynthesis; and the recent reintroduction of carbon dioxide by a particular advanced animal ... us! &amp;nbsp;Thus the issue of `global warming' that is widely discussed in modern society is but a single example of various ways life can affect their host planet. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</body>

    <body>&lt;p&gt;We begin Week 3&amp;nbsp;looking at the origin of life and we cover two topics:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://courses.ed.science.psu.edu/astro140/node/519"&gt;What is Life?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://courses.ed.science.psu.edu/astro140/node/520"&gt;Chemistry and Origin of Life&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://courses.ed.science.psu.edu/astro140/node/522"&gt;Life and Earth's atmosphere&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</body>

    <title>What is Life?</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/_legacy/astro140/bacteria.jpg" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img alt="Bacteria" class="lightbox" src="/_legacy/astro140/bacteria.jpg" style="width: 250px; height: 250px;"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="/_legacy/astro140/ldy1.jpg" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img alt="Insect on a green plant" class="lightbox" src="/_legacy/astro140/ldy1.jpg" style="width: 250px; height: 250px;"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="/_legacy/astro140/puppy.jpeg" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img alt="Animal (mammal)" class="lightbox" src="/_legacy/astro140/puppy.jpeg" style="width: 25%;"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Life of Earth today exhibits tremendous diversity:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Green grasses uses solar blackbody radiation plus H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;from the atmosphere to grow and produce grass seeds.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A white fungus grows on a dead tree in the forest, obtaining water and carbon-based molecules from the tree rather than the atmosphere, and may reproduce nearly in place so as to gradually cover more of the tree (and perhaps break off and be moved to a new location by wind or&amp;nbsp;another animal) or may create spores to spread similar to seeds.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Humans consume H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O and&amp;nbsp;organic molecules from plants and animals plus O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;from the atmosphere to grow, move around and make&amp;nbsp;baby humans through sexual reproduction. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bacteria near mid-oceanic ridges at the ocean floor use&amp;nbsp;sulfur-based chemicals and/or geothermal heat to grow and reproduce in darkness. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is extremely difficult to write an complete definition that includes all of this variety of life on Earth, let alone one that is useful for the search of extraterrestrial life. &amp;nbsp;Here are two possibilities (see our text sec 1.1.1 for a similar discussion):&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-left: 40px; "&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A living organism is something that can reproduce and evolve through natural selection.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-left: 40px; "&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A living organism extracts and organizes energy and material from its environment to preserve its existence, grow and produce similar independent organisms.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact that scientists seriously consider two definitions that are so different from each other&amp;nbsp;demonstrates how hard it is to develop a good&amp;nbsp;definition for life.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;For example, these definitions do not have some criteria satisfied by all terrestrial (Earth-based) life, such as `constituted of carbon-based molecules' or `require liquid&amp;nbsp;water as a solvent during some phase of their life'. &amp;nbsp;This is intentional. &amp;nbsp;We wonder if life forms could exist on other planets that have different chemistries and solvents. &amp;nbsp;For example, we will learn shortly that Saturn's moon Titan has rain/streams/lakes of liquid methane that are extremely different from environments on Earth, but it is not inconceivable that they&amp;nbsp;could harbor life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most scientists agree that some things are &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; alive:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Star&lt;i&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;It has a well-defined life-cycle (protostar --&gt; main sequence star --&gt; red giant --&gt; white dwarf or neutron star) and interacts with its environs (formed by gravitational collapse of ambient gas, illuminates planets).&amp;nbsp; But a star does not actively organize external energy or material and does not reproduce. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Planet&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;It has a complex internal and atmospheric structure and could be said to extract and organize energy from its host star, but&amp;nbsp;the key planet properties were set near the time of its formation based on the mass and&amp;nbsp;angular momentum of the material that formed the planet. &amp;nbsp;While a planet may be said to `evolve' as in change properties, it does not&amp;nbsp;reproduce, therefore it does not `evolve' in the technical sense refering to natural selection. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Robot or computer program?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;&amp;nbsp; Some computer programs are effective at learning from repeated trials. They fall underthe rubrics of `machine learning algorithms' or, less technically, `artificial intelligence' (AI). When an AI software system is connected to mechanical device, it is often called a robot. It is still unclear whether some future AI will achieve human-like self-awareness and creativity (though this is not a requirement for life). This issue addressed in a thoughtful way by the 2004 Hollywood movie&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0343818/" style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; " target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I,&amp;nbsp;Robot&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. It is debated whether a robot/AI could be built that is programmed to make a similar new robot (known as a Turing machine) and, if so, would it be alive? But we are far from having robots reproduce and evolve through natural selection. &amp;nbsp;You might find interesting some discussions of these issues with leading scientists &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/ask-the-experts-will-robots-take-over-the-world-16791"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://theconversation.com/how-we-built-a-robot-that-can-evolve-and-why-it-wont-take-over-the-world-52506"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Virus? &amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;These are exceedingly small biological structures consisting of protein and&amp;nbsp;RNA/DNA that invade living cells and use their DNA--&gt;RNA--&gt;protein machinery to reproduce themselves. &amp;nbsp;Viruses are&amp;nbsp;based on same chemistry as living organisms on Earth but are parasitic, requiring&amp;nbsp;host cells for reproduction. &amp;nbsp;It is not clear whether they should be considered living organisms. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p class="textbook_center text-center" style="text-align: center; "&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Living organisms are part of the natural world on Earth, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="textbook_center text-center" style="text-align: center; "&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;but have remarkable properties that are not shared by other parts &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="textbook_center text-center" style="text-align: center; "&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;of the terrestrial environment like the rocky surface, oceans, or atmosphere.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="textbook_center text-center" style="text-align: center; "&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;We now show that the molecules that constitute living organisms&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="textbook_center text-center" style="text-align: center; "&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;are drawn from the molecules that astronomers &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="textbook_center text-center" style="text-align: center; "&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;find throughout the Galaxy. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="textbook_center text-center"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Chemistry and the Origin of Life</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Chemical foundations of life&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All known living organisms on Earth are based on &lt;strong&gt;&lt;b style="color: rgb(153, 0, 0);"&gt;organic (carbon-based) molecules&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;: chains and rings of carbon atoms with H, O, N and occasional other elements. These are often combinations and polymers of simple molecules found in the Galaxy's interstellar gas and dust, which entered into the solar nebula and are now found in the atmospheres and ices around the Solar System. Examples:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (methane). Chains of methane give propane, octane (gasoline), wax and other &lt;strong&gt;hydrocarbons&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;with H and C atoms.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Add carbon rings to get soot and coal.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Chain of 5 CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + 6 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, a common &lt;strong&gt;&lt;b style="color: rgb(153, 0, 0);"&gt;sugar&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; produced by photosynthesis (Fig 1.5). Chains of sugar give starch, chitin and &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class="textbook_color1"&gt;&lt;b style="color: rgb(153, 0, 0);"&gt;cellulose&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;; the latter is the principal structural molecule of plants (e.g. the wood of trees). These are &lt;strong&gt;carbohydrates&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;with H, C and O atoms.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Chain of 3 CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + 1 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + 1 CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 1 NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;N gives alanine, one of ~20 common &lt;strong&gt;&lt;b style="color: rgb(153, 0, 0);"&gt;amino acids (Fig 1.6)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. Chains of amino acids give &lt;strong&gt;&lt;b style="color: rgb(153, 0, 0);"&gt;proteins&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;which are principal structural and functional molecules in all living organisms on Earth.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ring of 4 CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, 2 NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, 1 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O and 1 CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; gives nucleic acid thymine (Fig 1.8). Huge polymers of sugars, nucleic acids and PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; molecules gives deoxyribonucleic acid or &lt;b style="color: rgb(153, 0, 0);"&gt;DNA&lt;/b&gt; (Fig 1.9), the principal self-reproducing molecule containing the genetic code in living organisms.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;b&gt;Terrestrial life is thus based on macromolecules (cellulose, proteins, DNA, etc.).&amp;nbsp; Carbon is the crucial element for all known Earth-life. &amp;nbsp;All known Earth-organisms require liquid&amp;nbsp;water as a solvent for at least some life stage. &amp;nbsp;The&amp;nbsp;huge, complicated molecules of terrestrial life are themselves based on simple molecules, which&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;can found distributed throughout the Milky Way&amp;nbsp;galaxy .&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Chemistry of the Galaxy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It may be useful to&amp;nbsp;review our earlier class on &lt;a href="https://courses.ed.science.psu.edu/astro140/node/497"&gt;molecules in the interstellar medium&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;We found that there are dozens of known organic (carbon-based) molecular species identified in interstellar clouds. &amp;nbsp;Many are also found in protoplanetary disks where planets form. &amp;nbsp;Our text's Table 1.3 also gives a list. &amp;nbsp;Note that these are not exactly the same molecules that lie at the foundation of life on Earth (e.g. sugars, amino acids, bases), but they are closely related. &amp;nbsp;Thus, the Galaxy provides a rich mixture of organic molecules from which life can form .... if conditions are right!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Origin of life on Earth&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first clear cut examples of living organisms appearing in fossils is ~3.5 billion years ago, or ~1 billion years after Earth formed. &amp;nbsp;There is a debate among paleontologists ... some are convinced by evidence that living organisms were present as early as 0.5 billion years after Earth's formation (sec 2.4.5). &amp;nbsp; These are simple unicellular bacteria and algae which grew in mats on the surface of the ancient ocean. &amp;nbsp;The evidence for them are fossil structures called&amp;nbsp;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="color: rgb(153, 0, 0);"&gt;stramatolites&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;seen in ancient rockbeds (Fig. 2.16). &amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We do not know exactly how the first self-reproducing living system formed. &amp;nbsp;&lt;b style="color: rgb(153, 0, 0);"&gt;Laboratory experiments by Miller &amp; Urey&lt;/b&gt; starting in the 1950s show that amino acids and other fundamental organic molecules of living organisms can form from mixtures of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; plus solar energy and soils (Fig 1.19). &amp;nbsp;Other early experiments have taken amino acids and lipids in the laboratory and made cell-like spheres (Fig 1.30). &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;However, no self-reproducing molecule or cell has been formed in the laboratory.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp; We can only guess that somewhere on the Earth's complex surface, over hundreds of millions of years, a complicated molecular system based on left-handed amino acids emerged, began eating other organic molecules, and began reproducing. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the 19th century, Charles Darwin suggested life formed in a `warm little pond'. &amp;nbsp;It is plausible that the early Earth's seas concentrated organic molecules in drying pools or ponds &amp;nbsp;(sec 1.6.3). &amp;nbsp;And the chemistry in such shallow ponds can be accelerated by catalysis with certain minerals (sec 1.7.3). &amp;nbsp;Nonetheless, many attempts to reproduce the formation of complex polymers in simulated ponds, as we see in living organisms, &amp;nbsp;have failed. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some discussions of life on Earth, often motivated by ancient religious texts that describe the creation of life by a deity, conclude from this failure that the generation of self-reproducing chemical systems from naturally occuring chemicals is impossible. &amp;nbsp;Most scientists argue that the failure of laboratory experiments so far does not mean that ... over vast range of conditions and millions of years ... that it did not succeed on the early Earth. &amp;nbsp;However,&amp;nbsp;the expression "Absence of evidence does not imply evidence of absence" applies to such situation. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the basic idea of Miller-Urey-like experiments is foundational, the details of&amp;nbsp;these experiments were subsequently criticized for using gas atmospheres that are unlikely to be representative of the early Earth's atmospheres. &amp;nbsp;Even more recently, there has been renewed debate about the early Earth's atmosphere, so this laboratory work is far from conclusive. &amp;nbsp;Further complicating matters, recent advances in gene sequencing has tried to&amp;nbsp;identify a last universal common ancestor (LUCA). &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;While we don't have a definitive LUCA, several lines of evidence point towards genomes most similar to organisms&amp;nbsp;currently living deep in the ocean near hydrothermal vents. &amp;nbsp;If life on Earth originated in such an enviroment, then the Miller-Urey experiments are still interesting scientifically, but may be totally unrelated to the origin of life on Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In summary, the origin of life on Earth remains incompletely explained. &amp;nbsp;The ingredients of simple organic molecules are widespread in the galaxy, and are now being studied in protoplanetary disks where planets form (using the new ALMA telescope in Chile). &amp;nbsp;Organic molecules like amino acids were definitely present in our Sun's protoplanetary disk, as evidenced by the rich organic chemicals found in &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;carbonaceous chondrites,&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;certain rare meteorites from the Asteroid Belt that have landed on Earth (sec 1.5.3 and Table 1.5). &amp;nbsp;But we don't know how the first self-reproducing molecular system emerged. &amp;nbsp; But once the first RNA-type self-reproducing system did appear, then the development of a wide variety of living organisms comparatively easy to explain based on natural selection. &amp;nbsp;We treat the evolution of life on Earth in the next class. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</body>

    <title>The Evolution of Life</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Important stages of evolution of life on Earth&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Development of the first self-reproducing molecular systems, potentially based on RNA or another self-catalyzing information-carrying molecule. &amp;nbsp;A model of&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RNA world&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; is outlined in sec 1.8.1. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Development from a variety of primitive bacteria now seen in marshes, hot springs, caves and deep ocean vents. Probably ~3.8 Gyr ago.&amp;nbsp; Below are photos of ancient forms of life before photosynthesis arose that exist today around deep ocean vents (Fig 1.36) and in boiling hot springs in volcanic zones (Fig 2.27).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Development of photosynthetic bacteria and algae (e.g. &lt;a href="http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/bacteria/cyanointro.html" target="_blank"&gt;cyanobacteria&lt;/a&gt; which may have made the stramatolites) producing the oxygen-rich atmosphere. &amp;nbsp;3.0-2.5 GYr ago&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Development of a more complex biochemical system seen in most cells today (eukaryotes, mitochondria). 1.2 Gyr ago&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Development of simple animals (Precambrian era, 0.6 Gyr ago) including fishes (0.4 Gyr ago), insects &amp; dinosaurs (0.25 Gyr ago), mammals (0.065 Gyr ago), primates (0.005 Gyr ago), hominids (~0.003 Gyr ago) and the hypothetical most-recent common human ancestors&amp;nbsp;to all humans today (~0.0002 Gyr ago).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most species that have lived on Earth are now extinct (see &lt;font color="#330033"&gt;&lt;a href="http://tolweb.org/tree/" target="_blank"&gt;Tree of life&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/font&gt; for many examples). The processes of the evolution of life, proposed in the 19th century by Charles Darwin, are well-established. In particular, recent projects to determine the sequence of the DNA genetic codes of different organisms shows without doubt that all life forms on Earth, including humans, are related to each other. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Most species of life that have existed on Earth (~millions) are now extinct.&amp;nbsp; However, throughout evolution, the basic biochemical basis of inheritance (DNA &lt;--&gt; RNA &lt;--&gt; proteins, metabolism using ADP/ATP, etc.) has remained largely unchanged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Example of Evolution:&amp;nbsp; Origin and Diversification of Birds on Isolated Islands&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charles Darwin, the originator of modern theory of evolution, derived many of his ideas by studying the variety of animals on the isolated Galapagos Islands off the Pacific coast of South America. His analysis was based mainly on the easily seen characteristics like the structure of bird beaks.&amp;nbsp; Darwin did not know the underlying mechanisms for genetic transmission and diversification; this did not emerge until the 1950's when James Watson and Francis Crick used X-ray crystallography taken by&amp;nbsp;Rosalind Franklin to&amp;nbsp;unravel&amp;nbsp;the structure and genetic code of DNA molecules. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center; "&gt;&lt;a href="/_legacy/astro140/6279900896_b299ab6e60_b.jpg" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img alt="Phylogenic tree based on DNA sequences of Hawaiian and other birds (see text)." class="lightbox" src="/_legacy/astro140/6279900896_b299ab6e60_b.jpg" style="width: 400px; height: 286px;"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="/_legacy/astro140/6279901012_481e22e900_b.jpg" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img alt="Inferred progression of birds across the Hawaiian islands." class="lightbox" src="/_legacy/astro140/6279901012_481e22e900_b.jpg" style="width: 350px; height: 357px;"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, Darwin's basic idea&amp;nbsp;has been superbly validated by studied of the genetic code. &amp;nbsp;Above are results from a 2011 statistical analysis of sequences of &gt;20,000 DNA nucleic acid bases for Hawaiian birds (bottom) compared to common birds on large continents (middle and top).&amp;nbsp; The left-hand&amp;nbsp; `phylogenic tree' is based on mitochondrial DNA while the (very similar) right-hand tree is based on nuclear DNA.&amp;nbsp; The Hawaiian birds are found to be closely related to Asian finches, and only distantly related to other birds like the sparrow.&amp;nbsp; Combining mutation rates with other data, the biologists can trace the progression of the Asian finches from the western Hawaiian islands (~5 million years ago) to the eastern Big Island (&lt;1 million years ago).&amp;nbsp; See a &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/science/punctuated-equilibrium/2011/nov/02/hawaiian-honeycreepers-tangled-evolutionary-tree" target="_blank"&gt;news report&lt;/a&gt; on these findings. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center; "&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Life of Earth is incredibly rich and complex: there have been millions of species adapting to an incredible range of conditions. &amp;nbsp; A few of these species have astonishing intelligence, including us humans. &amp;nbsp;Yet all organisms share the same biochemical machinery (DNA, proteins, cells, etc.) and have closely intertwined genetic codes. &amp;nbsp;Despite the diversity of species, life on Earth is cohesive ... we, our puppy, the tree, the fruit fly and nasty bacteria are all cousins. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</body>

    <title>Life and Earth&#039;s Atmosphere</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;Here we tell a remarkable story. &amp;nbsp;From an astronomical perspective, Earth has the wrong atmosphere! Where does its oxygen come from? What happened to its carbon dioxide? What role did life play in changing the atmosphere billions of years ago ... and what role is it playing today? &amp;nbsp;This topic is perhaps the only time when our "Life in the Universe" studies address issues of great concern to public welfare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center" style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let us compare the three principal terrestrial planets: Venus, Earth, and Mars. &amp;nbsp;Each has a layer of volatile gases, liquids or solids on their solid surface. This is called the&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;atmosphere&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;of the planet. If the solar nebula theory for the origin of the solar system is right, then the atmospheres should have basically the same composition since they formed from the same protoplanetary disk material. But they don't!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;strong&gt;Venus:&lt;/strong&gt; 96% CO&lt;sub&gt;2,&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;3% N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, 1% H&lt;sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;strong&gt;Earth:&lt;/strong&gt; 0.02-0.7%&amp;nbsp;CO&lt;sub&gt;2&amp;nbsp;&lt;/sub&gt;(range over past 0.5 GYr),&amp;nbsp;78% N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, 21% O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, + lots of liquid/ice H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;strong&gt;Mars:&lt;/strong&gt; 96% CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, 3% N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, 1% Argon + lots of ice CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp; H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;strong&gt;Ices/gases in outer solar system and interstellar medium:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, He, CO, CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Planetary astronomers have developed a complicated scenario to explain why the planet atmospheres differ so much from the original solar nebula material.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Phase I: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;Planets form by gravitational collapse in protoplanetary disk around young Sun, 4.5 billion years ago.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The H and He gas that dominates the disk gas rapidly escapes (evaporates) from the inner planets due to their weak gravity and high temperatures.&amp;nbsp;Only Jupiter and Saturn are massive enough, and cold enough, to retain the light hydrogen and helium atoms. Heavier molecules with oxygen, nitrogen and/or carbon can be retained by Venus/Earth/Mars. The smallest bodies like Mercury/Moon/asteroids cannot retain any gaseous atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Phase II:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;are released from the molten interiors of the planets by outgassing, including&amp;nbsp;volcanism, geysers, and hydrothermal vents. Water can also be deposited on the surface by collisions with comets and asteroids.&amp;nbsp;(There is still significant debate among scientists on&amp;nbsp;the relative contribution of outgassing and comets or asteroids to Earth's ocean water.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;On all three planets, NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;is split by the Sun's ultraviolet light, the H atoms escape and the N atoms form N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;gas which we now see in all three planetary atmospheres.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;On hot Venus, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O is a gas (steam) and is destroyed by solar UV light like NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. On moderate-temperature Earth, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O is a liquid (water) or solid (ice) and collects into oceans and polar ice caps. On cold Mars, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O is entirely solid and resides in polar ice caps (and possibly permafrost below the surface)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center; "&gt;&lt;img alt="Diagram of the process by which ultraviolet light from the Sun dissociates (breaks apart) molecules like water and ammonia." class="lightbox" src="/_legacy/astro140/uvdissoc.gif" style="width: 45%;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;On Venus and Mars, the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;is unchanged and remains the dominant gas constituent of the atmosphere. But on Earth the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;gradually dissolves in the liquid water oceans (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;+ H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O ---&gt; H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO) where it combines with other molecules to form solid minerals (e.g. CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, limestone). These reactions proceed both by inorganic chemical reactions and by living organisms (e.g. diatoms and mollusk shells in shallow seas form thick layers of limestome). The atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;thus enters into the Earth's crust, where it is gradually is pushed into the Earth’s mantle in subduction zones by plate tectonics. Thus Earth alone has seen most of its CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;transported from its atmosphere into&amp;nbsp;its interior.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;On Mars, much of the atmosphere is eroded by the solar wind. Some of this is simply due to the&amp;nbsp;weaker gravity due to its lower mass. &amp;nbsp;Some of the atmospheric loss is likely due to the lack of a protective magnetic field (today). &amp;nbsp;It's thought that Mars once had a liquid core to generate a magnetic field, but since Mars was smaller, it cooled more rapidly and lost its magnetic field. &amp;nbsp;Some combination of those factors (and perhaps others) has resuled in a modern&amp;nbsp;Mars with a very thin atmosphere.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Phase III&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;(only on Earth)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;: Living organisms produce O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;on Earth. Free oxygen is difficult to form by inorganic chemistry and is very reactive with other molecules. But it is released in large quantities by green plants which undergo&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;photosynthesis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;6 CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;+ 6 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + solar light &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;---&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;+ 6 O&lt;sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus green plants have altered physical conditions on Earth in a very significant way, consuming the CO&lt;sub&gt;2 &lt;/sub&gt;and releasing abundant O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;in our atmosphere.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;As a result, nearly all of the Earth's CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;has been depleted, and&amp;nbsp;it constitutes only &lt;0.1%&amp;nbsp;of the atmosphere today. &amp;nbsp;Note that some living organisms benefit from this atmospheric change: &amp;nbsp;metabolic animals like humans breathe the oxygen, and eat the sugars and other organic molecules formed by green plants, drink the water from the atmosphere, and release some CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;back to the atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Phase IV&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(only on Earth):&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp; During the past ~300 years, human industrial society has been releasing CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;into the atmosphere by burning fossil fuels: coal, oil and methane (natural gas). These fuels are the buried remains of photosynthetic plants which lived 10&lt;sup&gt;7-8&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;years ago. This rapid resupply of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&amp;nbsp;&lt;/sub&gt;has increased the atmosphere's CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;from 0.028% to &lt;a href="https://www.co2.earth/" target="_blank"&gt;0.041% today&lt;/a&gt; and it is projected to&amp;nbsp;grow substantially in the 21st century and beyond.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Greenhouse Effect&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All molecules have quantized rotational and vibrational transitions. The molecule CO&lt;sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;happens to have the following quantum properties: it is transparent to visible light (i.e. most of the Sun's T~6000 K blackbody light) but strongly absorbs infrared light (i.e. most of a planet's T~300 K blackbody light). So CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;in a planet's atmosphere acts as a blanket keeping heat in. This `greenhouse effect' is strongest on Venus, which has an extremely hot surface due to its dense CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;atmosphere.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;But it is also present on Earth and Mars.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;On Mars, increased CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;from Olympus Mons and the other 3 volcanoes ~2-3 billion years ago probably led to the warming that produced the rivers and seas which are now cold and dry. &amp;nbsp;On Earth, roughly 90% of the infrared radiation from the Earth's surface is absorbed by the atmosphere. &amp;nbsp;It is eventually re-radiated out to space, but is causes a substantial warming of the surface by trapping the radiation so efficiently. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Question: Will the rise in Earth's CO&lt;sub&gt;2&amp;nbsp;&lt;/sub&gt;due to human industrial activity cause a global warming of the Earth's surface?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is one of the most important scientific questions of our time. There is now a broad consensus among climate scientists that global temperatures are indeed rising since&amp;nbsp;the late 20th century, and that this is due to the rapid reintroduction of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;by fossil fuel burning.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Due to the long residence time of in the atmosphere before it is absorbed into the oceans (~1000 years), the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;concentration is projected to&amp;nbsp;continue to rise into the foreseeable future. &amp;nbsp;The increases are likely to be even greater&amp;nbsp;due to increasing or even accelerating CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;production as more societies "moderize" and use more fossil fuels per capita. &amp;nbsp;Up-to-date information on climate issues can be found at the&amp;nbsp;latest (2014) reports of the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.ipcc.ch/" target="_blank"&gt;Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change&lt;/a&gt;;&amp;nbsp;see the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://ar5-syr.ipcc.ch/" target="_blank"&gt;synthesis report&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;where the figures here were obtained. &amp;nbsp;Penn State's&amp;nbsp;Professor Richard Alley, and several other Penn State faculty, are principal authors of the IPCC report. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The&amp;nbsp;figure below&amp;nbsp;shows the rise&amp;nbsp;in&amp;nbsp;CO&lt;sub&gt;2 &lt;/sub&gt; production over the past ~250&amp;nbsp;years due to modern industrial society.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure showing the rise in CO_2 production over the past ~250 years due to modern industrial society." src="https://courses.ed.science.psu.edu/astro140/sites/courses/ed/astro140/files/mooc_images/anthro-co2.jpg" style="width: 676px; height: 338px; "&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The panels&amp;nbsp;below present the manifestations of the resulting increased greenhouse effect and global warming: the temperature of the atmosphere at the Earth's surface (both global and regional), the melting of ices at the poles (similar melting of glaciers is seen in mountain ranges and Greenland), and the rise of the average sea level. &amp;nbsp;The relationships between greenhouse gases rise and global warming is&amp;nbsp;complicated; for instance, the warmer oceans evaporate faster, leading to more clouds where are generally reflect sunlight back into space, which cools the Earth.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;But the total effect is a net heating of 1-2 watts per square meter, and industrial human processes dominate the heating. &amp;nbsp;The total sunlight energy is 1400 W/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, and&amp;nbsp;the net heating is 1-2 W/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, roughly 0.1% of the Sun's energy on the Earth. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="These panels show the manifestations of the resulting increased greenhouse effect and global warming: the temperature of the atmosphere at the Earth's surface (both global and regional), the melting of ices at the poles (similar melting of glaciers is seen in mountain ranges and Greenland), and the rise of the average sea level." src="https://courses.ed.science.psu.edu/astro140/sites/courses/ed/astro140/files/mooc_images/global_warming.jpg" style="width: 868px; height: 740px; "&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An increase of&amp;nbsp;~0.1% of the total, does not seem very big. &amp;nbsp;However, and unfortunately, both measured evidence and detailed calculations indicate that this small heating has rather considerable effects on things we care about, such as the sea level, agricultural zones, storms, fresh water and deserts. &amp;nbsp;And the effects in the near future ... in&amp;nbsp;your lifetimes during the 21st century ... are predicted to be strong.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The figures below show global and regional changes expected up to 2100 for two models: one&amp;nbsp;(RCP6.0) where the world's greenhouse emission is sharply curtailed, and another (RCP8.5) where it continues to grow without check. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; For the latter model,&amp;nbsp;the average warming is 4 degrees C (7 degrees F)&amp;nbsp;but the effect is not evenly distributed across the globe.&amp;nbsp;The strongest heating is in the Arctic region, and there is great concern that the melting of permafrost in the tundra of Siberia and Canada may release yet more greenhouse gases, particularly methane. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align="center"&gt;&lt;img alt="However, the effects seen in the previous figure are not evenly distributed across the globe.  The strongest heating is in the Arctic region, and there is great concern that the melting of permafrost in the tundra of Siberia and Canada may release yet more greenhouse gases, particularly methane." src="https://courses.ed.science.psu.edu/astro140/sites/courses/ed/astro140/files/mooc_images/temp_21c.jpg" style="width: 860px; height: 331px; "&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Making predictions about the future of a complex system like the Earth is always difficult. &amp;nbsp;Nevertheless, it is important that scientists provide society and policy makers with their best assessments based on the data and models avaliable. Some of&amp;nbsp;the potential consequences are so severe, that they could have significant implications for society at large and particularly&amp;nbsp;people living in areas likely to be affected by flooding or extreme weather. &amp;nbsp;Examples of&amp;nbsp;some potential&amp;nbsp;consequences that have been predicted include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sea levels are projected to rise 0.4-0.9 meters over the next century, due to thermal expansion of the oceans and partial melting of the polar ice caps.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;On longer timescales, the Greenland ice sheet may melt entirely, leading to 7-meter rise in sea levels.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Coastal cities (NYC, Philadelphia, Washington D.C.,&amp;nbsp;Los Angeles, New Orleans in US; Shanghai, Tokyo, Calcutta, etc) and low-lying areas (nearly all of&amp;nbsp;Florida, Netherlands, Bangladesh, etc) would be flooded.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Glaciers continue to shrink, winter snows reduce, and Arctic ice disappears in summer. &amp;nbsp;These beginnings of these effects can be dramatically seen through time lapse photography, such as the &lt;a href="http://extremeicesurvey.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Extreme Ice Project&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Weather extremes (droughts, floods, hot spells) are projected to increase.&amp;nbsp;Hurricanes become stronger because warmer air stores more energy and moisture.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Regional weather patterns, such as rainfall, will change. &amp;nbsp;There may be some advanages&amp;nbsp;(e.g., opening of a Northwestet package through the Artic Ocean), but there will also likely be some people who are affected adversely. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Agricultural zones are projected to shift towards poles. Tropical diseases such as malaria and cholera are projected to expand to new areas.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Extinctions of plant/animal species as habitats warm (already happening with coral reefs and other fragile environments).&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Oceans currents may&amp;nbsp;change. &amp;nbsp;There is worry that the Gulf Stream which warms Europes may reverse. &amp;nbsp;This has happened in the past (long before people were around to farm) and could be devestating to agricultural economies and perhaps the global food supply.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;The effects of global warming are particularly evident in the rapid reduction of ice coverage at the Earth's polar and high mountain ragions. See short videos of the 10-year recession of a glacier near Juneau Alaska &amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://vimeo.com/168243535" target="_blank"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and warming at Glacier National Park in Montana &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur4I8tYnxP4" target="_blank"&gt; here&lt;/a&gt;. Short videos of Arctic Ice are &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fw7GfNR5PLA" target="_blank"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adQ2tarZyUY" target="_blank"&gt; here&lt;/a&gt;. The Antarctic ice has been less affected, but its outer regions are recently decreasing (see &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnCa_4NFcUc" target="_blank"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. On the timescale of one or more centuries, it is possible -- but still not well-established -- that all of the polar ice will melt. If this occurs,&amp;nbsp;flooding of coastal cities around the world is likely, as shown in the video &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbiRNT_gWUQ" target="_blank"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We thus see that the atmospheres of planets can change greatly, both from physical processes (such as the loss of water from Venus) and from biological processes (such as the increase of oxygen from green plants).&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Modern human society is now increasing greenhouse gases in the atmosphere and, even though the quantities seem very small, it has increased the Earth's temperature perceptibly in recent decades. &amp;nbsp;Ice is melting, ocean levels are rising, deserts are increasing. &amp;nbsp;Climate scientists agree that&amp;nbsp;the Earth's temperature will significantly more during the next centuries. &amp;nbsp;Human society will make difficult choices about how to&amp;nbsp;deal with the associated challenges. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</body>

    <title>The Terrestrial Planets</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;Earth and Mars orbit the Sun within the `Habitable Zone' where liquid water can potentially be present on the surface, depending on the atmospheric pressure and composition (and the presence of sufficient water). We therefore focus on the properties of these two planets and review the properties of Venus and Mercury only to contrast the conditions for planets too close to their star to be habitable. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 19px; line-height: 24px;"&gt;Earth&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rotating sphere with&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;&lt;b&gt;oceans&lt;/b&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;of liquid H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O and brown rocky&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;&lt;b&gt;continents&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, covered with a thin gaseous atmosphere with swirling clouds of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O clouds. Polar caps of frozen H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O. Continents show mountain ranges, volcanos, rivers and occasional impact&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;craters&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;. Below are two typical views of Earth, one from space and ther other from the surface. &amp;nbsp;See some beautiful images of Earth at NASA's&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://visibleearth.nasa.gov/" target="_blank"&gt;Visible Earth&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;(esp. the Blue Marble project).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-left: 80px; "&gt;&lt;img alt="A pretty photo of the Earth.  Note the blue ocean, atmosphere (seen here by is clouds of water) and rocky continents (brown rock and green planets)" class="lightbox" src="/_legacy/astro140/globe_west_540.jpg" style="width: 40%;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;img alt="" src="/_legacy/astro140/Ocean.jpg" style="width: 500px; height: 197px; "&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if one looks under the oceans, another remarkable pattern of&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;mid-oceanic ridges&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;and&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;&lt;b&gt;ocean trenches&lt;/b&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;are seen! &amp;nbsp;Watch a beautiful 2-minute video of the slowly spinning Earth &lt;a href="http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/mgg/image/images/LightsGlobe320x240.mov" target="_blank"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-left: 80px; "&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;img alt="" src="/_legacy/astro140/NOAA-NGDC_Slide15.jpg" style="width: 600px; height: 440px; "&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Earth's interior &lt;/strong&gt;is still mostly molten from its formation 4.5 billion years ago. The solid crust of light silicates is very thin: only 5-50 km (vs. total radius of 6400 km). Under the thin crust is a thick mantle of melted silicates, a liquid outer core, and an inner core of solid iron/nickel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earth's surface features are explained by&lt;em&gt;&lt;b&gt;&amp;nbsp;plate tectonics&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. First introduced by Alfred Wegener in the 1930s and largely disparaged at the time, it is now completely confirmed by GPS and radio astronomical measurements of continental motions. The Earth's surface is broken into ~20&amp;nbsp;&lt;b&gt;&lt;em&gt;crustal plates&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, which are moved in different directions by convection currents in the mantle. New crust forms by uplift and spreading of mantle material at mid-oceanic ridges, with the newest rock along the ridge line. Old crust is either&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;&lt;b&gt;subducted&lt;/b&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;into the mantle along a trench, or is crumpled upward into mountain ranges (e.g. the Himalaya Mountains being produced today as the Indian plate crashes into the Asian plate). Plate motions and subduction are violent processes and produce&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;volcanoes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, mountain ranges and&lt;b&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;earthquakes&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&amp;nbsp;along plate boundaries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-left: 80px; "&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/_legacy/astro140/Tectonic_plate_boundaries_clean.png" style="width: 775px; height: 429px; "&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Typical plate motions are 1-5 cm per year, roughly the rate at which fingernails grow, amounting to roughly 10&lt;sup&gt;3&amp;nbsp;&lt;/sup&gt;kilometers every 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;years. The diagrams below are two representations of convection from the mantle and its effects on the surface tectonic plates.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earth's active plate tectonics serve a key role in the "carbon cycle" that helps maintain the carbon dioxide concentration of Earth's atmosphere.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earth's crustal motions today:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Atlantic Ocean is widening, separating South America from Africa and North America from Europe. &amp;nbsp;North American &amp; Europe have collided repeatedly in the past. The Appalachian Mountains around us now are from 2 collisions ago -- &amp;nbsp;its counterparts on the other side are the Scottish highlands and Atlas Mountains in Morocco.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Australia and India are pushing into Asia. India's collision with Asia continues to raise&amp;nbsp;the Himalaya Mountains.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A sliver of western California is on the Pacific plate, which is sliding northward past the North American Plate, i.e.,&amp;nbsp;Los Angeles is moving towards San Francisco. This produces earthquakes (e.g. along the San Andreas fault in California) and volcanos (e.g. Mt. St. Helens in Washington State).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the Earth is 4.5 x 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; years old, the continents have collided and rearranged their configurations dozens of times. For example, 200 million years ago, all continents were stuck together into one super-continent, Pangaea. Note that if there were no plate tectonics, volcanism, and mountain building, rain would erode the continents into oceans and there might be no&amp;nbsp;"dry land" on Earth today.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earth is unique among the planets in having a relatively large-sized moon - the Moon, which is 1/80 the mass of Earth and orbits at a distance of 55 Earth radii. For this reason the Earth-Moon system is occasionally referred to somewhat humorously as a "binary planet". The most likely way for such a massive and nearby Moon to have been formed is by a cataclysmic collision, towards the end of the formation of the Solar System, between the proto-Earth and another roughly Mars-sized planetesimal. The collision would have ejected a large amount of Earth's crust into orbit, where it could have collected into the spherical body we see today. Key consequences of Earth's large Moon for life on Earth are that it raises large tides in our oceans, and stabilizes the tilt of Earth's axis (which is responsible for the seasons) over very long timescales. Tides in the Earth-Moon system are also slowing down Earth's rotation, and hence, the length of a day: At the time of the dinosaurs, each day was ~23 hours long, and currently the day is lengthening by 2 milliseconds per century.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 19px; line-height: 24px;"&gt;Mars&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mars' rotation rate (1/24.6 hours) and axial tilt (25.19 deg) give it a day and seasonal temparature variations. However, Mars is significantly smaller and so has weaker gravity (40% of Earth's) and a much thinner atmosphere (&lt;1% Earth's surface pressure), with a predominantly carbon dioxide (3% nitrogen) composition which offers no evidence of current life.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below are three images of Mars. The first visual picture, from a telescope on Earth, shows dark and light patches once thought to be 'canals' built by the Martians themselves, along with a polar ice cap and some light cloud cover. The second visual picture (center) from an orbiting satellite probe shows the Valle Marineris, two large volcanos, streambeds, and craters. The third image shows the four extinct volcanoes in exaggerated relief. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/_legacy/astro140/Mars_telescope.jpg" style="width: 313px; height: 299px; "&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;img alt="" src="/_legacy/astro140/1024px-Mars_Valles_Marineris.jpeg" style="width: 300px; height: 300px; "&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;img alt="Computer generated image of Mars with greatly exaggerated relief.  " class="lightbox" src="/_legacy/astro140/mars_paul_bourke.jpg" style="width: 28%;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The surface of Mars consists of lots of red-colored dust covering rocks (often a grey-greenish color), plus small polar ice caps of frozen CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O. The red color is from oxidized iron-rich minerals (i.e. rust). Some regions are heavily cratered - these are more ancient surfaces that have not changed in billions of years, while other lightly-cratered regions have been renewed more recently by lava (volcanism) or water erosion. The region of the planet imaged by VIking (image in center, and exaggerated model on right) exhibits four huge extinct volcanos and a huge canyon system.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;b&gt;Olympus Mons&lt;/b&gt;: largest volcano in the solar system (size of PA and 25 km high).&amp;nbsp;&lt;b&gt;Valles Marineris&lt;/b&gt;&amp;nbsp;is the deepest and longest canyon system in the Solar System, as big as the U.S. It may have resulted from the separation of two tectonic plates long ago when the interior of the planet was still molten.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;img alt="Olympus Mons, the large extinct volcano on Mars.  It is very similar in structure to the volcanos in the Hawaiian islands on Earth.  Note the cliff-like edges at the base of the lava flow; this suggests it was once eroded by a water ocean.

&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mars is now mostly cooled to a solid, but had a molten interior for much of its history. For some period (up to ~2 billion years ago?), active volcanism brought molten rock up from the interior. Most remarkably, small features around certain canyons and craters suggest that liquid water once flowed on Mars. Possibly due to a greenhouse effect and global warming from gases ejected by volcanos. Today nearly all the water on the surface is frozen. &amp;nbsp;Only very recently have scientists found evidence for liquid water briefly being exposed on the surface of Mars (before sublimating or freezing). &amp;nbsp;Carl Sagan and others suggest that life may have formed on Mars during its wet period. Following are some of the remarkable photos taken by Mars orbiters during the past decades showing the complex surface of the planet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The interior of Mars is mostly solid, unlike Earth's interior that is molten. This is because Mars is smaller and less massive (about 1/10 the mass of Earth) and hence has cooled faster since its formation 4.5 billion years ago. (Mercury and the Moon are even smaller and have entirely cooled.) &amp;nbsp;Earth's surface is very young, constantly remade by erosion (rain, rivers), volcanic lava flows, and plate tectonics. Mars's surface is partly old with many impact craters, and partly newer with lava flows and water erosion. The surfaces of planets thus reflect conditions in the planetary interiors.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</body>

    <title>Jovian Planets and Moons</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;The Jovian planets - Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune - probably have cores (suspected to be liquid metal for Jupiter and Saturn, but primarily&amp;nbsp;ice for Uranus and Neptune), but are "mostly atmospheres," comprised of dense gas. Below are photographs of the planets by robotic probes, and an artist's diagram of their interiors. The Jovian interiors are composed primarily of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;and He, with important amounts of methane (CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), water (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O), ammonia (NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) and related molecules. The Jovian planets thus reflect better the original material than the terrestrial planets where most of the gases have escaped.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the extremely high pressures at the interface with any&amp;nbsp;surface, it seems unlikely that the Jovian planets harbor living organisms. We will therefore review them briefly and concentrate instead on their moons which seem more likely sites for life. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/_legacy/astro140/721px-PIA04866_modest.jpg" style="width: 250px; height: 355px; "&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;img alt="Saturn, seen during a rare storm.  The dark streak across the middle is the shadow of the icy ring system. " class="lightbox" src="/_legacy/astro140/saturn-storm-color-stu.jpg" style="width: 24%; "&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;img alt="" src="/_legacy/astro140/Uranus.jpg" style="width: 250px; height: 253px; "&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;img alt="" src="/_legacy/astro140/Neptune.jpg" style="width: 250px; height: 245px; "&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jupiter&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;has more mass than all of the other planets put together, and is only about 1/10 the mass it would need to initiate deuterium fusion reactions in its core (the "easiest" type of fusion for a star). Thanks to its mass and 10-year orbit, Jupiter would likely be the first planet discovered by an alien civilization searching for planets around our Sun using techniques like those we use today (as we will discuss in the final unit of the course). Jupiter shines more brightly in the night sky than any star, and is outshined only by the Moon and Venus. Its strong magnetic field causes occasional bright radio flares brighter than any other radio phenomenon in the Solar System apart from the Sun. Its atmosphere exhibits bands caused by high-altitude winds and gargantuan hurricane-like stoms, including the famous "Red Spot" storm, which is roughly the size of&amp;nbsp;ten Earths and has persisted in its atmosphere for more than three centuries. Jupiter has four large moons, discovered by Galileo, that rival Mercury in size and some of which may offer suitable habitats for life, as we discuss below and will explore further in the weeks ahead.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Saturn&lt;/strong&gt; is a less massive, more distant version of Jupiter exhibiting similar visual colors, including banded high-velocity clouds and storms, and having a similar atmospheric composition. Its appearance in telescopes is the most dramatic of all the planets, thanks to its giant ring system, likely the disrupted remains of a moon that wandered too close to the planet in the relatively recent past (&lt;1 Ga ago) and was torn apart by Saturn's tidal forces. Saturn has a single massive moon, Titan, roughly the size of Mercury, the only planetary satellite in the Solar System to have a substantial atmosphere and weather. Titan is another possible habitat for life which we will explore in more detail in the weeks ahead. Saturn, easily observed with the naked eye, is the most distant (slowest moving) of the planets known to ancient astronomers.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Uranus and Neptune&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;have been called the "ice giants" because they exist in the cold outer reaches of the Solar System and exhibit atmospheres with significant ice content and a different mix of gases than Jupiter and Saturn, giving them their blue-green (or if you prefer, cyan) appearance in visual-light images. Both are too faint to be seen with the naked eye (with ocassional exceptions for Uranus), and were not discovered until after telescopes were in widespread astronomical use. Uranus is noted for the unusual 97 degree tilt of its rotational axis, which means it effectively rolls around the Solar System on its side instead of spinning like a top as the other planets do (Venus can be considered to be upside down, and spins slowly, which is also unusual). Neptune has a single massive moon, Triton, which orbits in the "wrong" (retrograde) direction and so is thought to be a captured Kuiper Belt object. Triton's properties, including its very tenuous nitrogen atmosphere, are very similar to those of Pluto and other massive Kuiper Belt objects, and with current understanding it is too cold and too far from the Sun to possibly support life.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our current picture of the interiors of these gas giants is shown in the figure below.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;img alt="Diagrams of the interiors of the Jovian planets.  These are based on astrophysical models and are not entirely certain.  " class="lightbox" src="/_legacy/astro140/jovian_interiors.jpg" style="cursor: default; border-width: 0px; border-style: initial; border-color: initial; width: 541px;"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 19px; line-height: 24px;"&gt;Moons of Jupiter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 19px; line-height: 24px;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jupiter has four large inner moons discovered by Galileo: Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto. The pictures here are from the&amp;nbsp;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold; "&gt;Galileo&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;robot probe launched by NASA that orbited Jupiter and photographed its moons from 1995-2003.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Images of the four Galilean moons around Jupiter.   The relative sizes are realistic." class="lightbox" src="/_legacy/astro140/fg08_02.jpg" style="width: 90%;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Io&lt;/b&gt;&amp;nbsp;is closest to Jupiter and, subjected to enormous tidal forces of the giant planet, should have its spin locked to its orbital period like our Moon's spin is locked to its orbit, with the same side always facing its planet. But the pull of the next moon out, Europa, disturbs Io's orbit, with the result that Io is constantly being "massaged" by Jupiter's tidal forces, which heat and melt its icy and rocky interior. As a result, Io is the most volcanically active body in the Solar System (below). With many constantly erupting volcanos, its surface covered with recent lava flows, and its complete lack of any atmosphere, Io's surface and interior are probably too harsh and unstable for life. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-left: 40px; "&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/_legacy/astro140/768px-Iosurface_gal.jpg" style="width: 500px; height: 500px; "&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Europa&lt;/b&gt;&amp;nbsp;(below, left) has&amp;nbsp;an icy surface with long dark cracks and no craters. These surfaces show evidence of having been repeatedly melted and refrozen. Models of this phenomenon suggest there is a large ocean beneath a thick icy crust that may contain more liquid water than exists in all the oceans of Earth. As with Io, tidal forces of Jupiter likely provide sufficient heat to keep this water from freezing. The evidence for existence of these oceans, their likely properties, and their potential for harboring life will be a focus for us in the weeks ahead.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ganymede &lt;/strong&gt;(below, right) and&lt;strong&gt; Callisto&lt;/strong&gt; exhibit relatively young surfaces that, again, suggest the presence of large quantities of liquid water - or, at the very least, "slush" - below the surface of both moons, again because of Jupiter's tidal influence, combined with the tidal forces of the other inner moons. We will discuss prospects for life on these moons as well.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Surface of Europa photographed by the Galileo probe.  The insert shows details of the cracked and refrozen surface. " class="lightbox" src="/_legacy/astro140/europa2.jpg" style="width: 40%;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;img alt="Detail of the surface of Ganymede showing both refrozen ice and small impact craters." class="lightbox" src="/_legacy/astro140/07291996_browse.jpg" style="width: 40%;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Moons of Saturn&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saturn's moons, discovered by Christian Huygens in the 1600s, are now being investigated by the&amp;nbsp;Cassini&amp;nbsp;probe which arrived there in 2005. &amp;nbsp;There&amp;nbsp;are dozens of moons, most with ancient icy surfaces covered in craters. Some have large cracks suggesting heating and expansion from large collisions. Saturn's largest moon is&amp;nbsp;Titan, the only moon with a substantial atmosphere and observed weather patterns. The surface features are invisible due to clouds (below, left), and models suggest that Titan may have liquid N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;(nitrogen),&amp;nbsp;CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;(methane), &amp;nbsp;or C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;(ethane) oceans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;p&gt;See an excellent&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/video/videodetails/?videoID=127" target="_blank"&gt;video of Huyghens probe's descent onto Titan&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;and an artist's view of &lt;a href="https://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/resources/674/?category=videos" target="_blank"&gt;Titan's&amp;nbsp;interior&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cassini dropped a research probe named Huygens (built by the European Space Agency) onto Titan in 2005. It took some remarkable photos during its descent (below, center) and after landing on the surface (below, right) - the only visible light photos we have of the surface of this alien world. The last photo shows stream-beds kilometers in length and surface material with a mix of light and dark colors. It is much too cold for liquid water; the liquid seen flowing on Titan's surface (center) is likely to be methane or ethane.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/courses/astro140/sites/edu.courses.astro140/files/content/titan_cassini.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="Saturn's moon Titan seen in visible light by the Cassini probe" class="lightbox" src="/_legacy/astro140/titan_cassini.jpg" style="width: 38%;"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;img alt="Surface of Titan photographs by the Huygens probe during its descent to the surface." class="lightbox" src="/_legacy/astro140/titan_descent.jpg" style="width: 28%;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;img alt="Photo of Titan's surface taken by the Huygens probe after landing." class="lightbox" src="/_legacy/astro140/titan_surface.png" style="width: 21%;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saturn's moon Enceladus is another example of an icy moon like the Galilean satellites of Jupiter. The existence of liquid water under its surface has been confirmed by the &lt;em&gt;Cassini&lt;/em&gt; mission's&amp;nbsp;observations of jets of water vapor erupting from its surface. We will discuss Enceladus along with Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto in a couple of weeks.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Moons of Uranus and Neptune&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Uranus and Neptune have a number of prominent moons, most with ancient, heavily cratered icy surfaces. Uranus' moon&amp;nbsp;&lt;b&gt;Miranda&lt;/b&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;(below, left) is remarkable: it looks like different terrains have been pieced together. Giant cliff separates two regions. Perhaps Miranda was shattered into pieces by collision with an asteroid/planetisimal, and reformed itself. &amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Triton&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;(below, right) is the largest of Neptune's moons and has very strange charateristics: it orbits in the wrong direction, and its surface has two different terrains (smooth melted material, and rough colored material). The moon is extremely cold and the surface is mainly nitrogen ice (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, bluish) &amp;nbsp;on one side and methane ice (CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, pinkish) on the other. It appears to have (active?) volcanos (erupting nitrogen? water? soot?). &amp;nbsp;Triton is the only large moon with a retrograde orbit, so it may have melted during its capture by Neptune long ago. But the surface has very few craters, so it must have been altered many times since the original capture.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Uranus' moon Miranda, photographed by the Voyager 2 probe" class="lightbox" src="/_legacy/astro140/fg08_14.jpg" style="width: 52%;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;img alt="Neptune's moon Triton" class="lightbox" src="/_legacy/astro140/inset-nep_triton-large.jpg" style="width: 37%;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Minor Bodies: Asteroids, Comets, Kuiper Belt Objects</title>
    <body>&lt;h2&gt;Asteroids&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asteroids and comets are small rocky and icy bodies left over from the Sun's protoplanetary disk. The term "asteroid" is used to refer to billions of small rocky bodies of a vast range of sizs that orbit the Sun. Most of them are in roughly circular orbits in the &lt;strong&gt;Asteroid Belt&lt;/strong&gt; between Mars &amp; Jupiter. It is likely that gravitational perturbations of Jupiter and, to a much lesser extent, Mars prevented the formation of a bona fide planet at this orbit in the Solar System.&amp;nbsp;Some asteroids have unusual orbits, such as the &lt;strong&gt;Trojan Asteroids&lt;/strong&gt; that are found tracking Jupiter's orbit in two "clouds" centered 60 degrees ahead of and behind the giant planet. &amp;nbsp;The figure below shows asteroids with known orbits ... this is not an artist's painting, but a plot of the real locations of the larger &amp; brighter bodies in the Asteroid Belt.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-left: 160px; "&gt;&lt;img alt="Diagram of the inner Solar System where the yellow dots are real asteroids with known orbits.  Note the clumps of Trojan asteroids trapped in Jupiter's orbit.  " class="lightbox" src="/_legacy/astro140/asteroid_belt.jpg" style="width: 60%;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A relatively small number of asteroids have had their orbits altered by Jupiter's gravity and can approach Earth. &lt;strong&gt;Meteors&lt;/strong&gt; (also called 'shooting stars', though they have nothing to do with stars!)&amp;nbsp;are fragments of asteroids or comet material which burn up in Earth's atmosphere, making a brief streak in the sky. &lt;strong&gt;Meteorites&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;are the pieces that don't burn up and land on Earth where they can be collected and studied in detail. Meteorites landing in most places are hard to distinguish from regular Earth rocks, so most meteorites are found in deserts or on the polar ice caps (e.g., Greenland or Antarctica). &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In recent years, a few asteroids have&amp;nbsp; been photographed by robotic probes during close fly-bys: Eros, Ida and its tiny 'moon' Dactyl, Mathilde, and most recently Vesta. The fly-bys have revealed that the surfaces of these asteroids are rocky (silicate) with craters from impacts by other asteroids. In 2001, the robotic NEAR probe crashed into Eros, taking closeup photos on the way in. Mathilde is darker and less dense; it may be a less well-bound, loose 'rubble pile' containing mostly sooty carbonaceous material. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-left: 120px; "&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;img alt="Eros, photographed by the NEAR space craft" class="lightbox" src="/_legacy/astro140/eros.jpg" style="cursor: default; border-width: 0px; border-style: initial; border-color: initial; width: 198px;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;img alt="One of the last photos by the NEAR probe before it crashed into Eros.

&lt;blockquote style="margin-top: 10px !important; margin-right: 10px !important; margin-bottom: 10px !important; margin-left: 50px !important; padding-top: 10px !important; padding-right: 10px !important; padding-bottom: 10px !important; padding-left: 38px !important; "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Take a look at the remarkable movies of Eros spinning as it orbits the Sun&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/mission/near/near_eros_anim.html" style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; " target="_blank"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;nbsp;These movies cover only a few hours; imagine how Eros has been spinning like this for 4.5 billion years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asteroids occasionally come close to planets and collide with them. Asteroid collisions of sufficient size will produce impact craters. The Moon and Mercury show many such craters, showing that our Solar System is a hazardous environment; most of the craters on Earth, Venus, and Mars have been erased over time by volcanism and erosion. Below left is a relatively new crater on Earth that you can visit in Arizona. Below right is an older, heavily eroded, &amp;nbsp;crater in Canada from 200 Myr ago. &amp;nbsp;A huge crater from a ~10 km-size asteroid that impacted 65 million years ago was identified under water, off the coast of Mexico's Yucatan peninsula. Some combination of the tidal waves (tsunamis), atmospheric debris, hemisphere-spanning forest fires, and Sun-obscuring dust and soot that followed this impact probably killed most land-based life on Earth, leading to the extinction of the dinosaurs and many other species that marks the Cretaceous-Tertiary ("K-T") boundary in the geological record. It is suspected that asteroid or comet impacts were also responsible for some of the other mass extinctions in Earth's past. Astronomical efforts are under way to discover and map out the orbits of all large asteroids with orbits that could allow them to hit Earth, so that we will have enough warning to organize evacuations (for small objects) or deflect the asteroid's orbit (for large objects). Deflecting the orbit of a large asteroid would require a dedicated space mission and years of advance warning to be successful. Luckily, the&amp;nbsp;chances are low that an impact large enough to have an impact on a global scale&amp;nbsp;will occur in the next ~thousand years. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-left: 40px; "&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/_legacy/astro140/1024px-Impact_crater.jpg" style="width: 800px; height: 160px; "&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meteorites, which are pieces of asteroids landing on Earth, can be studied in the laboratory in great detail to tell us about ancient planetisimals. Their properties are surprisingly diverse and complex. Most seem to be made of rock similar to Earth and Moon, but much of the rock is in small melted spheres called chondrules. &amp;nbsp;Some are iron-rich and must have been formed inside melted ('differentiated') planetisimals. Others are definitely unmelted; they still have grains inherited from the Galactic material from which the solar system formed long ago. &amp;nbsp;Below left is an ordinary chondritic meteorite. &amp;nbsp;Below right is a piece of the Murchison meteorite, a rare type of&amp;nbsp;carbonaceous chondrite&amp;nbsp;where amino acids and other organic molecules have been found. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

This is a very important carbonaceous chondrite that dates from the beginning of the Sun's protoplanetary disk.  The small melted rocks are chondrules.  The matrix in between is a hydrocarbon similar to soot or coal.  This carbon may have been important for the origin of  life on Earth." class="lightbox" src="/_legacy/astro140/allende.jpg" style="cursor: default; border-width: 0px; border-style: initial; border-color: initial; width: 275px;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;img alt="" src="/_legacy/astro140/Murchison_meteorite_0.459g.jpg" style="width: 304px; height: 338px; "&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Comets&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comets, like asteroids, are debris left over from the solar nebula and the formation of the Solar System. While asteroids are rocky bodies found (for the most part) in the Asteroid Belt between Mars and Jupiter, comets are mainly icy bodies that are found (for the most part) in the outer reaches of the Solar System in the Kuiper Belt, beginning just beyond the orbit of Neptune, and in the spherical Oort Cloud, far beyond at 50,000 AU, which effectively defines the edge of the Solar System. Most cometary bodies never come into the inner Solar System. Occasionally, however, a comet's orbit is altered by some gravitational encounter and it zooms towards the Sun. Its orbit typically has an eccentricity of e=99%, a semi-major axis of a=50,000 AU, and an orbital period of P~10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;years. A few comets that enter the inner reaches of the Solar System in this way are redirected into shorter orbits and become "periodic" comets; the most famous of these is Halley's Comet with an orbital period P=76 years. Below are some photos from the last passage of Comet Halley near Earth in 1986. We now have close-up images of several comets from robotic probes: they are irregularly shaped, loosly packed bodies of water ice, rocks, and dust.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spend some time learning about the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/deepimpact/multimedia" target="_blank"&gt;Deep Impact mission&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;to Comet Tempel 1 in 2005&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/deepimpact/multimedia" target="_blank"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; NASA sent a spacecraft to approach a comet as it was approaching the Sun, and ejected a metal probe to slam into the surface, releasing ice and rocky particles that were then studied by telescopes on or near Earth.&amp;nbsp; Take a look at the `Night of the Comet' interactive feature, as well as the approach and departure videos (`Journey to a Comet' and `Tempel Fades into the Night'). &amp;nbsp;You may be interested in reading `Genesis of a Comet' to link the findings to the protoplanetary disk where planets form. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In summer 2011, NASA's Dawn spacecraft visited Vesta, one of the largest asteroids in the Asteroid Belt.&amp;nbsp; See video overviews of this mission&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmzrrgdfIkk&amp;list=PL0fAPLcb7lSDbgp505khh-TufVVaubP73&amp;index=5" style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;" target="_blank"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Amazingly, astronomers witnessed the collision of a comet with Jupiter in 1994! The comet was broken into fragments by Jupiter's gravitational tidal forces on its first close passage by the planet in July 1992&amp;nbsp;and impacted the planet on its next orbit over July 16 to 22, 1994. These impacts resulted in huge disruptions to the atmosphere of Jupiter&amp;nbsp;which were observed from Earth-based observatories, the Hubble Space Telescope, and the Galileo spacecraft, then on its way to Jupter. Here are pictures before and after the collision taken by the Hubble Space Telescope.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Kuiper Belt Objects (KBOs)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, astronomers have discovered hundreds of Solar System bodies in orbits beyond Neptune. These are called Trans-Neptunian Objects (TNOs) or Kuiper Belt Objects (KBOs, named after astronomer Gerard Kuiper). &amp;nbsp;We now know that Pluto is thus just one among a huge number of rocky/icy bodies in the outer solar system. In the "zoom out" of the Solar System below, the upper-right panel has the best scale to show the Kuiper Belt (labeled in cyan). &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Orbits in the inner and outer Solar System" class="lightbox" src="/_legacy/astro140/sed3orb.jpg" style="width: 60%;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Kuiper Belt extends from 30 to 50 AU, with a sharp outer edge that is not well explained by current models. The Kuiper Belt objects are probably primitive objects, largely unchanged since the formation of the Solar System. Those with approximately circular orbits have probably had these orbits since birth, while those with more elliptical orbits - including Pluto - have experienced gravitational interactions wtih Neptune.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pluto, and several other known Kuiper Belt objects, orbit the Sun twice in the time Neptune orbits it three times; they have a mean orbital radius of ~39 AU (with various individual eccentricities and inclinations) which puts their orbit in "resonance" with Neptune's, making their orbits stable over long timescales. Pluto has three moons (below). In 2006, NASA launched the &lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/newhorizons/main" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;New Horizons&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; mission to Pluto and hopefully one or two other KBOs. It flew&amp;nbsp;by Pluto and its moons in 2015 and is scheduled to fly by 2014 MU69 near January 1, 2019. &amp;nbsp;Watch some of the amazing &amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/newhorizons/videos/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;videos containing images obtained by New Horizons during the Pluto and Charon encounters&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="A Hubble Space Telescope image of Pluto and its moons.  " class="lightbox" src="/_legacy/astro140/plutonamesfig.jpg" style="width: 45%;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The artist's painting below shows the largest KBOs known so far. Eris is slightly bigger than Pluto, and the others are somewhat smaller. Because Pluto is no longer alone, the international astronomers' society classified all of these Kuiper Belt objects including Pluto as 'dwarf planets' in 2005 - the famous "demotion of Pluto". Sedna, alone among these trans-Neptunian objects, is not a Kuiper Belt object, since its orbit extends out to 937 AU and inward only as far as 76 AU which is beyond the edge of the Kuiper Belt (see the diagram of Sedna's orbit, as a red ellipse, in the lower-right panel of the figure above). Sedna is likely a former Oort Cloud object which has experienced multiple gravitational perturbations leading to its current position.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Visualize planetary orbits with a&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.theplanetstoday.com/#" target="_blank"&gt;digital orrery&lt;/a&gt;. First take a look at the configuration of the orbits right now. &amp;nbsp;Then click on the arrow and then slide the green balls to change the speed, zoom and other characteristics of future motions. &amp;nbsp;Note how the inner planets orbit faster ... this is Kepler's Third Law, P&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;= a&lt;sup&gt;3&amp;nbsp;&lt;/sup&gt;(the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the orbit size). &amp;nbsp;While the terrestrial planets have few moons (Earth has one large moon, Mars has two small ones captured from the Asteroid Belt), the Jovian planets are orbited by an endless number of small bodies. &amp;nbsp;See a table of 181&amp;nbsp;named moons with links to photos and more information at the &lt;a href="http://www.windows.ucar.edu/tour/link=/our_solar_system/moons_table.html" target="_blank"&gt;Windows to the Universe website&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn are easily seen with the naked eye and have been known since antiquity. In the late 1600s, Isaac Newton Laws of Motion and Gravity, combined with the methods of calculus he invented, gave a quantitative understanding of the elliptical orbits and masses of the planets and their moons. &amp;nbsp;Uranus was discovered with a telescope by amateur German astronomer William Herschel in 1781, later appointed Royal Astronomer of England. Neptune was discovered in 1846 in France based on predictions using Newton's celestial mechanics. &amp;nbsp;Uranus had a non-elliptical motion due to the pull of a then-unknown planet. The first asteroid in the Asteroid Belt between Mars and Jupiter, Ceres, was discovered by accident in 1801. &amp;nbsp;Today, tens of thousands of asteroids have known orbits. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Altogether, the discovery of the outer Solar System bodies caused tremendous excitement throughout Europe during the 18-19th centuries, giving confidence both in the improved technology of telescopes, in the theoretical predictions of Newton's "celestial mechanics," and in the rationality of the world around us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond Neptune are many minor bodies collectively known as Kuiper Belt Objects (KBOs), most discovered since the 1990s. The most famous is Pluto, discoveredi in the U.S. in 1930 based on perturbations of Uranus' orbit after long searching. Michael Brown (at Caltech in California) and Devid Jewitt (at the University of Hawaii) have found hundreds of KBOs, and new large surveys are planned to find many more.&lt;/p&gt;</body>

    <title>General Considerations</title>
    <body>&lt;h2&gt;Conditions for Life Arising on Planets and Moons&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Liquid Oceans or Ponds&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A liquid is needed as solvent for speeding up chemical reactions which are slow in gases (and extremely slow in solids). The most promising molecule is water (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) &amp;nbsp;Water has nice advantages: solvent for many materials (that is, many chemicals dissolve in water); wide range of liquid phase (between its freezing temperature 0&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;C and boiling temperature 100&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;C); has a polar structure (a property of liquid water that promotes chemical reactions); and its solid phase (ice) floats on its liquid phas (water). But there are other possible solvents where life conceivably might form including ammonia (NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), methane (CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) or other hydrocarbons. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Organic Molecules&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are carbon-based (C) molecules with hydrogen (H), oxygen (O) and nitrogen (N). Terrestrial biological molecules also use small quantities of ~21 other elements: phosphorus (P) in DNA, calcium (Ca) in bones/teeth, iron (Fe) in blood, etc. Living organisms based on non-carbon molecules seems doubtful. For example, silicon (Si) has the same valence as carbon (4 free electrons), but polymers based on silicon tends to be solid crystals (rock) rather than chains and rings. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Energy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A source of energy to drive chemical reactions is needed. For terrestrial life today, the principal energy source is sunlight that, through photosynthetic plants with chlorophyll, can produce organic molecules like sugars from simple atmospheric molecules like water and carbon dioxide. &amp;nbsp;But some terrestrial life forms (mostly archaea bacteria or extremophiles) get energy from sulfur, hydrogen or methane in unusual locations such as deep sea vents. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Life in the Solar System? &amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From these general conditions for a habitable planet or moon, we can see why Earth is a great place for life to arise and thrive. Its orbit is perfectly placed in the&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;habitable zone&lt;/strong&gt; where water is mostly liquid (oceans, lakes, rain). &amp;nbsp;As we learned last week, the early Earth had lots of carbon in its atmosphere in the form of carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) which became available for living organisms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sunlight on Earth is bright as a source of energy, but not too strong to destroy complex organic molecules. &amp;nbsp;Basically, Earth is a great place for life!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, based on the conditions above, we can pretty much exclude some locations in the Solar System as habitable environments: &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center; "&gt;&lt;a href="/_legacy/astro140/messenger_mercury4.jpg" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img alt="Typical portion of Mercury photographed by NASA's MESSENGER space probe" class="lightbox" src="/_legacy/astro140/messenger_mercury4.jpg" style="width: 30%;"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="/_legacy/astro140/apollo_11_aldrin.jpg" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img alt="Astronaut Buzz Aldrin on the Moon in July 1969 (Apollo 11), photographed by Neil Armstrong, the first human to walk on the Moon" class="lightbox" src="/_legacy/astro140/apollo_11_aldrin.jpg" style="width: 30%;"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The planet &lt;strong&gt;Mercury&lt;/strong&gt; and our &lt;strong&gt;Moon&lt;/strong&gt; are small with gravity too weak to hold on to any gaseous or liquid atmosphere. &amp;nbsp;There are no organic (C-based) molecules or oceans on Mercury or Moon, just a rocky surface. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center; "&gt;&lt;a href="/_legacy/astro140/07_08_figure.jpg" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img alt="The surface of Venus photographed by the Soviet Venera space probe" class="lightbox" src="/_legacy/astro140/07_08_figure.jpg" style="width: 30%;"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="/_legacy/astro140/jupiter_cassini.jpg" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img alt="Jupiter's atmosphere photographed by the ESA/NASA Cassini space probe" class="lightbox" src="/_legacy/astro140/jupiter_cassini.jpg" style="width: 30%;"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Venus&lt;/strong&gt; can also be excluded as a possible site for life because its surface is so hot due to the runaway greenhouse effect from its dense CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; atmosphere. &amp;nbsp;All water boiled away billions of years ago, and any organic molecules on Venus would quickly be destroyed by the heat.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Jovian planets&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;—&lt;/strong&gt;Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune&lt;strong&gt;—&lt;/strong&gt;are unlikely site for the emergence of living organisms because their&amp;nbsp;cores are buried under enormously dense atmospheres of hydrogen or methane. &amp;nbsp; There are carbon-rich molecules, so it is conceivable that (from&amp;nbsp;gas chemistry rather than water-based liquid chemistry) self-reproducing organisms arose in the swirling Jovian atmospheres, but this seems doubtful.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center; "&gt;&lt;a href="/_legacy/astro140/m_halley3.gif" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img alt="Comet Halley photographed from Earth in 1986.  The tail is composed mostly of water molecules with some carbon-rich molecules and silicate (rocky) dust" src="/_legacy/astro140/m_halley3.gif" style="width: 70%;"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="/_legacy/astro140/halley.jpg" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img alt="The nucleus of Comet Halley (a few kilometers across) photographed by the German Giotto space probe in 1986.  The glowis from heater water vapor but the surface is a black carbon-rich material" class="lightbox" src="/_legacy/astro140/halley.jpg" style="width: 20%;"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Comets,&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;which spend most of their lives far from the Sun beyond the Kuiper Belt, might seem to be inhospitable to life due to the cold temperatures and lack of energy source. &amp;nbsp;But they do have two important ingredients: &amp;nbsp;water (comets are mostly made of water ice) and organic molecules. &amp;nbsp;When it was imaged by spacecraft during its 1986 approach to the Sun, the nucleus of Comet Halley was `black as velvet', probably covered with some carbon material like soot or coal. &amp;nbsp;While not harboring life forms themselves, comets may have been important in helping life arise on the early Earth. &amp;nbsp;Many likely impacted Earth, giving it water for its oceans and simple organic molecules for early living organisms. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center; "&gt;&lt;a href="/_legacy/astro140/allende.jpg" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img alt="The Allende carbonaceous chondrite meteorite with carbon-rich matrix" class="lightbox" src="/_legacy/astro140/allende.jpg" style="width: 40%;"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="/_legacy/astro140/murchison_crop.jpg" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img alt="The Murchison carbonaceous chondrite.  Trace amino acids and other organic molecules are found in the dark matrix" class="lightbox" src="/_legacy/astro140/murchison_crop.jpg" style="width: 30%;"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Some &lt;b&gt;asteroids&lt;/b&gt; in the Asteroid Belt are also very interesting with respect to life. &amp;nbsp;The most primitive meteorites which come from a class of asteroids in the Asteroid Belt are called&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;carbonaceous chondrites. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;These have rocky chondrules surrounded by a dark carbon-rich matrix similar to coal. &amp;nbsp;In this matrix, dozens of different amino acids and other organic molecules have been found in trace amounts. &amp;nbsp;These molecules are "racemic" (equal quantities of right- and left-handed molecules), while amino acids in living organisms on Earth are all left-handed.&amp;nbsp; This shows they are definitely not due to contamination after they landed on Earth, but were formed in the interstellar medium or the early solar nebula. &amp;nbsp; As with comets, it is likely that the impacts of many asteroids on the early Earth provided water and organic materials that could be valuable for the origin of life on Earth&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It thus seems that, aside from Earth, most of the Solar System seems inhospitable to life.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;But, in recent decades, interest by scientists has concentrated on the possibility of life in two specific Solar System environments:&amp;nbsp; The surface of Mars, and the surface or interiors of some Jovian moons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We now proceed to investigate these possibilities.&lt;/p&gt;</body>

    <title>Jovian Moons</title>
    <body>Prior to the fly-by missions of the Voyager probes in the 1980s, there was little expectation of liquids needed for life anywhere in the Solar System beyond Mars. The reason is simply temperature: the Sun's light is so faint at these distances that no body's surface can reach the melting temperature of water. &amp;nbsp;Scientists expected that the moons would either be rocky like the asteroids, or icy with ancient frozen surfaces, showing only craters from many asteroid impacts. &amp;nbsp;Jupiter's biggest moon, Callisto (shown below), is a good example of this, as well as many smaller Jovian moons. &amp;nbsp;&lt;p style="text-align: center; "&gt;&lt;a href="/_legacy/astro140/09_19_figure.jpg" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img alt="Jupiter's moon Callisto showing an old, heavily cratered icy surface" class="lightbox" src="/_legacy/astro140/09_19_figure.jpg" style="width: 400px; height: 454px;"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: left; "&gt;It was thus a big surprise when Voyager found several moons with young, active surfaces, showing few impact craters. Understanding these moons was a major motivation for the complex and expensive missions of the 2000s: the NASA's Galileo probe, which orbited within Jupiter's system, and European Space Agency's (ESA's) Cassini mission that is still orbiting within Saturn's system. &amp;nbsp;Jupiter's innermost moon, Io (not shown here, see LUBS Fig 9.9), nearly entirely melted by tidal stresses, has many active volcanoes that perpetually cover the surface with new material. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: left; "&gt;But it was Jupiter's moon Europa (and similarly, Ganymede) that seemed most relevant to the search for life in the Solar System. It has a water ice surface like Callisto, but very few craters. &amp;nbsp;The surface must have been melted and refrozen. &amp;nbsp;The strange grooves, rough patches, and&amp;nbsp;multicolored ice suggest that this melting is a recurrent process, not from a single violent event. Study the pictures below. &amp;nbsp;Dark ice fills some grooves and patches on the surface. &amp;nbsp;This suggests that the ice covering is not very thick, and liquid (or slushy) water lies below and wells up when the surface cracks. &amp;nbsp;The rough patches on the surface (chaotic terrain) may be the product of ice plates grinding against each other, similar to mountain-building on Earth due to plate tectonics.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center; "&gt;&lt;a href="/_legacy/astro140/europa.jpg" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img alt="The surface of Jupiter's moon Europa showing an icy surface without impact craters, photographed by the Galileo probe" class="lightbox" src="/_legacy/astro140/europa.jpg" style="width: 90%;"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center; "&gt;&lt;a href="/_legacy/astro140/europa_ridges.jpg" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img alt="Close-up photos of Europa's surface and a model for the formation of these small ridges" class="lightbox" src="/_legacy/astro140/europa_ridges.jpg" style="cursor: default; border-width: 0px; width: 80%;"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: left; "&gt;This requires that Europa have a liquid water layer beneath a relatively thin ice crust. &amp;nbsp;This is supported by the presence of a weak magnetic field around Europa. &amp;nbsp;What keeps it above freezing temperature? &amp;nbsp;Perhaps it is tidal forces (weaker than Io's) due to its slightly elliptical orbit and perturbations by other moons. &amp;nbsp;Perhaps large impacts episodically melt the interior. &amp;nbsp;The thickness of the ice crust and the water ocean is quite uncertain; below are two models for Europa's interior. &amp;nbsp;NASA engineers and scientists have conceptually designed a mission that would land on Europa with a probe that would melt its way through the ice and swim in the hidden ocean. &amp;nbsp;But this &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPCpNlVJBr8" target="_blank"&gt;ice-penetrating robot mission&lt;/a&gt; has not been approved by NASA or Congress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: left; "&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center; "&gt;&lt;a href="/_legacy/astro140/europa_interior.jpg" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img alt="A recent model of Europa's interior showing a liquid water ocean beneath the surface ice" class="lightbox" src="/_legacy/astro140/europa_interior.jpg" style="width: 50%;"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="/_legacy/astro140/799px-pia01130_interior_of_europa_0.jpg" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img alt="Another model for Europa's interior" src="/_legacy/astro140/799px-pia01130_interior_of_europa_0.jpg" style="width: 40%;"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: left; "&gt;Jupiter's moon Europa is not the only one that appears to have melted interior. &amp;nbsp;Neptune's moon Triton is bizarre, half covered with an ancient cratered surface and have with a smooth uncratered surface. &amp;nbsp;Perhaps it collided with another moon and partially melted. &amp;nbsp;Saturn's moon Enceladus shows some craters, but also has discolorations and grooves. &amp;nbsp;Here the Cassini probe has photographed geysers (essentially water volcanoes) along a long ridge. &amp;nbsp;As with Europa, this can be explained only if the surface ice is relatively thin and a (partially) melted layer lies below. &amp;nbsp;Here are some photos of Enceladus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center; "&gt;&lt;a href="/_legacy/astro140/09_26_figure.jpg" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img alt="Saturn's moon Enceladus showing geysers of water vapor,  photographed by the Cassini probe " class="lightbox" src="/_legacy/astro140/09_26_figure.jpg" style="width: 40%;"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="/_legacy/astro140/enceladus_jets.jpg" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img alt="Enceladus' water jets shown in false color " class="lightbox" src="/_legacy/astro140/enceladus_jets.jpg" style="width: 50%;"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: left; "&gt;We finally come to Saturn's moon Titan, the largest in the Solar System. &amp;nbsp;It was already known from ground-based studies that it is the only moon with its own atmosphere, mostly nitrogen (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) with some methane (CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;). &amp;nbsp;The surface cannot be seen in visible light due to the thick clouds, but Cassini has obtained detailed maps of the surface in infrared light and radar reflectance. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center; "&gt;&lt;a href="/_legacy/astro140/titan_cassini.jpg" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img alt="Titan seen in visible light by the Cassini mission" class="lightbox" src="/_legacy/astro140/titan_cassini.jpg" style="width: 40%;"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="/_legacy/astro140/titan_fulldisk_cassini.jpg" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img alt="Full disk of Saturn's moon Titan showing the surface in infrared light, photographed by the Cassini probe" class="lightbox" src="/_legacy/astro140/titan_fulldisk_cassini.jpg" style="width: 50%;"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: left; "&gt;The remarkable Cassini mission has a separate probe names Huyghens that was launched into Titan's atmosphere, descending slowly with parachutes, and landing softly. &amp;nbsp;The results were amazing! &amp;nbsp;The photos during the descent showed a complicated system of streams flowing into lakes. &amp;nbsp;The landing was squishy, onto a marshy surface. &amp;nbsp;The `rocks' on the surface (probably water ice) seemed embedded in a muddy material. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: left; "&gt;What is the liquid on Titan? &amp;nbsp;It is much too cold for liquid water, and the atmosphere does not show water vapor. &amp;nbsp;The liquid seems to be a hydrocarbon: methane, perhaps combined with ethane (C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;). &amp;nbsp;On Earth, this is called LNG, liquified natural gas, and is used as a fuel. &amp;nbsp;Titan seems to have a full climate with polar methane ice caps, methane clouds and rainstorms, rivers and lakes. &amp;nbsp;Cassini has traced a seasonal cycle involving warming with lake evaporation, and cooling with expanding ice caps. &amp;nbsp;Models of Titan's interior suggest that another liquid layer may be present, this time liquid ammonia (NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center; "&gt;&lt;a href="/_legacy/astro140/titan_descent.jpg" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img alt="Photo of methane streams on Titan, photographed by Cassini's Huyghens probe as it parachuted to the surface" src="/_legacy/astro140/titan_descent.jpg" style="width: 40%;"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="/_legacy/astro140/titan_surface.png" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img alt="A photo from the surface of Titan showing rocks in a `muddy' soil (the liquid is probably methane)" class="lightbox" src="/_legacy/astro140/titan_surface.png" style="width: 30%;"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: left; "&gt;One can only speculate whether life can arise on Titan's surface where the temperature is around 90&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; K. &amp;nbsp;Recent laboratory experiments (similar to the Miller-Urey experiments for early Earth) indicate that amino acids and nucleic acids, critical components of proteins and DNA, could form if the temperature were hotter. &amp;nbsp;Astronomers note that, in a few billion years, the Sun will become a red giant star, boiling water on Earth but warming Titan to more habitable temperatures. &amp;nbsp;Altogether, after Earth, Titan seems to have the best chance for life in the Solar System with a solid surface, carbon-rich chemistry, a liquid solvent, and ecological variety. &amp;nbsp;Last year, NASA approved funds for preliminary study of a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titan_Mare_Explorer" target="_blank"&gt;Titan Mare Explorer&lt;/a&gt; that would splash-land in one of its methane lakes and study its chemistry. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We thus find that, contrary to any reasonable expectation before detailed study with robotic probes, that some Jovian moons have liquid on (or close to) their surfaces. &amp;nbsp;Europa and similar moons have water oceans below their ice coverings, and Titan has incredible liquid hydrocarbon lakes on its surface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is likely that, in coming decades, humans will send more probes to the moons to study them ... and look for primitive live forms.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</body>

    <title>Life on Mars</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;Chapter 3 of our text &lt;em&gt;An Introduction to Astrobiology&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;gives a detailed and very informative treatment of the Martian surface, atmosphere and history from the perspective of the question of whether the planet can -- or could in the past -- harbor living organisms. &amp;nbsp;The final answer is that, despite intensive effort over decades, there is no evidence for life on Mars, but the possibility of past life is real. &amp;nbsp; This Web page can be used as a commentary to assist as you read Chapter 3. We will skip text sections 3.4.4, 3.5 and 3.6, and all of the blue-color Boxes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Historical perspective (Chpt 3.1)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Enthusiasm for the possibility -- even supposed certitude -- that life exists on Mars has persisted for centuries. Below left is a typical image of Mars obtainable from a ground-based telescope. &amp;nbsp;In the late-1800s, Giovanni Schiaperelli claimed he saw `&lt;i&gt;canali'&lt;/i&gt;, an Italian word that can mean either canals (implying that they were engineered, rather than arising through weathering) or&amp;nbsp;channels (which can be either man-made or arising through weathering). &amp;nbsp;'Canali' was translated to "canals" in English, and it just so happened to be during an era&amp;nbsp;when humans were building increasingly impressive canals (shoftly after the completion of&amp;nbsp;the Suez canal and before an early attempt at the Panama canal). &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;In a series of popular books, Percival Lowell (1895-1908) proclaimed that they represented constructions of an advanced civilization dying of thirst. &amp;nbsp;In 1898, author and futurist H. G. Wells wrote a popular novel about an invasion of Earth by technologically advanced Martians. &amp;nbsp;This was recouped in 1938 in a radio drama by Orson Welles that caused widespread panic. &amp;nbsp;By the late 1920s, it was well established that the surface of&amp;nbsp;Mars was dry. Yet, some speculation remained, and&amp;nbsp;it was not until NASA's robotic flybys (1960s) and landers (Viking missions, 1970s) that is was completely established that no large forms of life is present on Mars; &amp;nbsp;thousands of pictures have been returned from the Martian surface, and no Martian animals, plants, footprints or other indications of large life forms is seen. &amp;nbsp;The controversy today is whether there might be microbial life, or perhaps&amp;nbsp;fossils of past life from an era when the climate was warmer and liquid water was prevalent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center; "&gt;&lt;img alt="High quality photo of Mars from a ground-based telescope" class="lightbox" src="/_legacy/astro140/mars2.jpg" style="width: 40%;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;img alt="Drawings of Mars by Percival Lowell claiming to show changing canals" class="lightbox" src="/_legacy/astro140/lowell_mars_channels.jpg" style="width: 50%;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center; "&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 style="text-align: left; "&gt;Martian geography (Chpt 3.1.1)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surprisingly, the most prominent feature of the Martian surface is actually not well-understood: the dramatic difference in cratering between the southern and northern hemispheres (Figure 3.5). &amp;nbsp;This is known as the &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martian_dichotomy" target="_blank"&gt;Martian dichotomy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;A heavily cratered surface is ancient, unchanged since the first ~billion years of the Solar System's 4.5 billion year history when many planetesimals remained from the planet formation process in the Sun's protoplanetary disk. &amp;nbsp;In particular, several hundred million years after the formation, the planets were subject to the&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Late Heavy Bombardment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; ...&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;this caused, for example, the `mare' on our Moon. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the southern portion of Mars' surface has been unchanged for most of its history, why is the northern portion (about 1/3 of the surface) so free of craters? One possibility is a truly giant impact hit the north after most of the other bombardment was completed. &amp;nbsp;We see river beds flowing from the southern portion into the north, so perhaps evidence of the giant crater have been mostly eroded by water flows. &amp;nbsp;Another possibility is early tectonic activity caused by a molten mantle under the Martian crust. &amp;nbsp;Earth has a thin crust and lots of tectonic activity with ~20 plates that constantly slam into each other, subduct under each other, and cause volcanic eruptions. &amp;nbsp;The result on Earth is that all ancient impact craters are erased. &amp;nbsp;The giant canyon Valles Marineris on Mars does resemble a rift valley where two plates are separating on Earth, and there are several huge extinct volcanoes. &amp;nbsp;But we really don't know the explanation for the Martian dichotomy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; font-weight: normal; font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 17px;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Martian atmosphere (Chpt 3.2)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[There are lots of details in this section that we don't have to study, including Table 3.1, Fig 3.9, and the details of chemical reactions (3.2)-(3.6)] &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top: 0.6em; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.2em; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; "&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Amount of atmosphere:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; It is very interesting to compare the atmospheres of Mars, Earth and Venus, trying to understanding the similarities and differences. &amp;nbsp;Earth as an atmosphere with intermediate density, around 1 bar pressure. &amp;nbsp;But most of the volatile material is liquid water in the oceans; only a tiny fraction of water is in vapor or clouds. &amp;nbsp;This contasts sharply with&amp;nbsp;Venus that has an extraordinarily dense atmosphere with roughly 100 bar pressure at the surface. &amp;nbsp;Due to its proximity to the Sun, it is too hot for any molecule (particularly water) to be liquid, so essentially every volatile molecule entered the atmosphere. &amp;nbsp;On the other hand,&amp;nbsp;Mars has a very low density atmosphere around 1 mbar (millibar = 1/1000 bar) pressure. &amp;nbsp;We do expect a planet with lower gravity like Mars to retain less atmosphere, and some volatiles are stored in the frozen polar caps. &amp;nbsp;But Mars still seems to have lost a lot of its original atmosphere. &amp;nbsp;We believe this is due to the solar wind that couples with the outer Martian atmosphere and blows it away into the outer Solar System. &amp;nbsp;This process is not well-understood, and &lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/maven" target="_blank"&gt;NASA's MAVEN probe&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;was specifically designed to investigate this process: "Scientists will use MAVEN data to determine the role that loss of volatiles from the Mars atmosphere to space has played through time, giving insight into the history of Mars' atmosphere and climate, liquid water, and planetary habitability". &amp;nbsp;MAVEN was launched to Mars in November 2013 (delayed from the 2012 launch listed in Table 3.1) and has begun collecting data to address these questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top: 0.6em; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.2em; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; "&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Composition of atmosphere&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;Both Mars and Venus seem to have their original atmospheres provided&amp;nbsp;by volatile chemicals that accompanied the planetesimals that formed the planets (with some expected changes, such as ammonia NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; undergoing photolysis to form nitrogen N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). &amp;nbsp;These atmospheres early are expected to have been 96% CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (Table 3.2). &amp;nbsp;So the big question is: Why does Earth have only 0.03% CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in its atmosphere? &amp;nbsp;And why does Earth have so much oxygen O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, a very reactive gas? &amp;nbsp;The history of Earth's atmosphere is complex, but there are two major ingredients. &amp;nbsp;First, unlike Venus (where the oceans boiled long ago) and Mars (where the oceans froze long ago), Earth has liquid water oceans that dissolve atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;; to form carbonic acid, which undergoes chemical reactions into limestone and other carbonates that is incorporated into crustal rock. &amp;nbsp;We see that Earth's CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; abundance is likely similar&amp;nbsp;to that of &amp;nbsp;Venus,&amp;nbsp;if one considers these rocks (Table 3.6). &amp;nbsp;Second, around ~3-2 billion years ago, microbial life (probably cyanobacteria) developed the chemical reactions known as photosynthesis that converts atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; into organic molecules like sugars, starch and cellulose. &amp;nbsp;We learned about the role of cyanobacteria during Theme II on the development of life on Earth. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; font-weight: normal; font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 17px; "&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evidence for liquid water in Mars' past (Chpt 3.4)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our class on&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;The terrestrial planets&lt;/em&gt; in our&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Review of our Solar System&lt;/em&gt;, we described many surface features of Mars indicating liquid water was present in the past: &amp;nbsp;streambeds flowing from overfilled craters; craters surrounded by mud flows; dry meandering riverbeds; lake shorelines; gullies around the Valle Marineris canyon system; scarps (cliffs) around the base of Mons Olympus. &amp;nbsp;Recent rovers making close-up studies of the Martian landscape found ripple patterns in rock; sedimentary layers of rock; carbonates (like limestone) and ball-shaped hematite minerals that can only form under water. &amp;nbsp;Our text covers much of the same material in 3.4.1-2, but also discusses how advanced techniques (not simple imaging of the surface) can be used to locate current water content under the Martian surface (pp. 104-106). &amp;nbsp;You can read online some recent findings about water on Mars released since the textbook was published&amp;nbsp;including&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/MRO/news/mro20110804.html" style="color: rgb(2, 122, 198); text-decoration: none; " target="_blank"&gt;seasonal changes&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;in gullies, a layer of&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.cfm?release=2011-377&amp;cid=release_2011-377" style="color: rgb(2, 122, 198); text-decoration: none; " target="_blank"&gt;gypsum&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;(calcium sulfate with water, CaSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;-2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O), and radar indications of a former large&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.marstoday.com/news/viewpr.html?pid=35969" style="color: rgb(2, 122, 198); text-decoration: none; " target="_blank"&gt;ocean&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;If water once flowed on Mars, the atmosphere must have been more massive than it is today. &amp;nbsp;If Mars had a significantly more massive atmosphere, then&amp;nbsp;we would also suspect that the&amp;nbsp;temperature on the surface where the water flowed would have been considerably warmer than the global average temperature on Mars today due to an increased greenhouse effect from more carbon dioxide and other gases (water? methane? sulfur dioxide? nitrous oxide?) in the past. &amp;nbsp;Several causes for the gradual loss of warming atmosphere may be involved: &amp;nbsp;the ablation (stripping away) of Mars' atmosphere by the Sun's wind (see &lt;em&gt;Amount of atmosphere&lt;/em&gt; above); the destruction of water (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) by the Sun's ultraviolet radiation and subsequent loss of hydrogen to space; ejection due to the explosions from large asteroid impacts; the end of active volcanism as the planet cooled and crust thickened; chaotic changes in the planet's obliquity (axis of rotation). &amp;nbsp;Our understanding of Mars' ancient climate is still quite uncertain and is actively studied today. &amp;nbsp;Professor James Kasting in Penn State's College of Earth and Mineral Sciences is one of the world's distinguished scholars studying the atmospheres and climates of the terrestrial planets. &amp;nbsp;You can see &lt;a href="/courses/astro140/sites/edu.courses.astro140/files/content/kasting_early_mars_climate.pdf" style="color: rgb(2, 122, 198); text-decoration: none; "&gt;a talk &lt;/a&gt;he gave to astronomy undergraduates in 2008 on the early warming of Mars.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; font-weight: normal; font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 17px; "&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evidence for life on Mars (Chpt 3.3)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;nbsp;have no evidence for life on Mars. &amp;nbsp;No Martian rabbit has been photographed hopping across the surface of the planet. &amp;nbsp;While sedimentary rocks have been seen, no fossils of ancient life has yet been photographed. &amp;nbsp;There was once an argument that a meteorite called ALH 84001, that was ejected from the Martian surface by an asteroid impact, has micro-fossils, but it is not widely believed this evidence is not convincing (Chpt 3.5). &amp;nbsp; No messages or visits from Martian civilizations have been identified (outside of fictional stories). &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But with the clear knowledge that liquid water once flowed profusely on Mars, and the presence of carbon dioxide gas in the atmosphere and carbonate minerals in the rock indicating that organic (carbon-based) molecules were present, and of course the presence of sunlight as an energy source, we satisfy the basic conditions for the emergence of living organisms. &amp;nbsp;Thus, there is intense interest today in establishing whether life once was present on Mars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the late-1970s, NASA launched two excellent probes that landed softly on Mars (although, unlike more recent probes, they did not have wheels and the ability to move) and provided our first close-up view of the Martian surface. &amp;nbsp;These Viking landers had a robotic shovel that scooped up soil and placed in into three small laboratories specifically designed to search for active life forms (Chpt 3.3). &amp;nbsp;The results were tantalizing! &amp;nbsp;When Martian soil is placed into water, it fizzes, absorbing carbon dioxide and releasing oxygen just like green plants on Earth. &amp;nbsp;However, a mass spectrometer experiment revealed no organic molecules at all. &amp;nbsp;These apparently contradictory results have been explained as the consequence of the Sun's ultraviolet light irradiating the soil giving rise to suboxide or peroxide minerals. &amp;nbsp;When placed in water, these materials can absorb carbon dioxide and emit oxygen ... but without any metabolism of living organisms (analogous to the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxjb2UJZ-5I" style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; " target="_blank"&gt;fizzing&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;of a common treatment for stomach distress). &amp;nbsp;See details &lt;a href="http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/O/OyamaHypoth.html" target="_blank"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is one other curiosity (sec 3.4.5). &amp;nbsp;Telescopes in Hawaii have taken infrared spectra of the Martian atmosphere for many years. &amp;nbsp;In 2003, &lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/mars/news/marsmethane.html" target="_blank"&gt;methane&lt;/a&gt; was seen over localized regions of the northern hemisphere during its summer. &amp;nbsp;Methane on Mars should be rapidly (few years) destroyed by solar ultraviolet ... so where did it come from? Is it from the ancient atmosphere, trapped in the rock for billions of years and suddenly released? &amp;nbsp;Or, as on Earth, is the methane generated by microbial life? &amp;nbsp;This puzzle has not been solved. &amp;nbsp;A recent&amp;nbsp;probe by NASA, the &lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/msl" target="_blank"&gt;Mars Science Lander&lt;/a&gt; (nicknamed Curiosity), now on the Martian surface has a variety of advanced experiments specifically to look for microbial life. &amp;nbsp;While there have been many &lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/feature/jpl/nasa-rover-findings-point-to-a-more-earth-like-martian-past" target="_blank"&gt;interesting geological and geochemical results&lt;/a&gt; supporting the idea that Mars once have significant liquid water,&amp;nbsp;no evidence for current or past life has yet emerged. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</body>

    <title>The Discovery of Exoplanets</title>
    <body>&lt;h3&gt;Exoplanets: Historical Context&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For most of the history of astronomy, there was only one planetary system known: our Solar System. &amp;nbsp;Despite some past enthusiasms (see the historical overview in the 'Introduction' lecture of Week 1), most astronomers were very pessimistic that planets could be found orbiting other stars by now. The reflected light (in the visible light band) due to Earth is billions of times fainter than the the sun,&amp;nbsp;and the Earth is so close to the Sun that the sunlight dwarfs the faint light reflected by Earth for any alien observers looking at the Sun from a planet orbiting another star. The dynamical effects —&amp;nbsp;pulling and pushing through its gravitational interactions—of an Earth-analog planet on its host star are tiny: typically velocities of less than a meter&amp;nbsp;per second&amp;nbsp;(hundreds of millions times smaller than the speed of light), typical motions less than a thousandth of an arcsecond on the sky. &amp;nbsp;When an Earth-size&amp;nbsp;planet briefly passes in front of a sun-like star, the fraction of the star's surface blocked by the planet is&amp;nbsp;just ~0.01%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was starting out in science, all of these measurements were completely impossible to achieve. &amp;nbsp;Thus, no one had any empirically-based knowledge of whether planetary systems were rare or common, whether our Solar System is typical or extraordinary. And by inference, no one had any empirically-based knowledge about whether planets that could host life. &amp;nbsp;Given the impracticality of detecting planets like those in our solar system,&amp;nbsp;no rational astronomer would devote serious effort to discovering planetary systems. &amp;nbsp;Even the few who did dream of searching for planets, acknowledged that they couldn't justify spending the time, money or telescope time just to search for planets. &amp;nbsp;Instead, they gradually developed the technology to detect low-mass stars and brown dwarfs, in hopes that someday it would be possible to discover planets around other stars. &amp;nbsp;Fortunately, nature produces some planetary systems that are much easier to detect that our own. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The situation completely changed with the discovery of the first exoplanet orbiting the Sun-like star 51 Pegasii in 1995. It was found because the situation was totally unlike our Solar System: A planet with mass greater than Jupiter's was orbiting the star closer than Mercury, not far above the star's surface. This was extraordinary! As "hot Jupiters" were found, astronomers feverishly worked to improve the quality of their spectrographs, their high-resolution cameras, and their photometric cameras ..... vast efforts have been exerted since ~2000 to improve the technologies for planet detection. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The work has been rewarded more richly than even optimists imagined. Only since ~2010, have we had scientific data to conclude that&amp;nbsp;roughly half of the stars we see at night have planetary systems of some sort (and perhaps even more). Most stars with one detectable planet have additional planets. Many are unlike our Solar System, but the data are strongly indicating that a non-trivial fraction of stars have roughly Earth-size or Earth-mass planets in Earth-line orbits.&amp;nbsp;This provides a profound vindication for the optimists about Life in the Universe that we discussed in Week 1 of the class—from Lucretius in ancient Rome, to Bernard de Fontenelle in Renaissance France, to Carl Sagan in 20th century America. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, there is much more that we do not know about these planets. &amp;nbsp;In many cases, we know either the planet's size or mass, but not both. &amp;nbsp;We know precious little about their composition,&amp;nbsp;atmospheres, and surfaces. &amp;nbsp;Penn State's Center for Exoplanets and Habitable Worlds includes several faculty designing the next generation of planet hunting instruments and surveys. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will spend four weeks, Weeks 8-11, studying how the recent discoveries of exoplanets&amp;nbsp;were made, the charcteristics of the planets, and the abundance of known planets. &amp;nbsp;This sets the stage for the final theme of our course, discussion of the potential for&amp;nbsp;life on these exoplanets. This week, Week 8, we will lay the groundwork for the exoplanetary discoveries by discussing methods for finding planets. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PLEASE BE CLEAR: &amp;nbsp;ASTRONOMERS HAVE FOUND LOTS OF PLANETS. &amp;nbsp;THEY HAVE NOT FOUND ANY LIFE ON THESE PLANETS.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Catalogs of Exoplanets&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some general resources that you can glance at now, but refer back repeatedly during our study of exoplanets. &amp;nbsp;Take a look at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory's&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://planetquest.jpl.nasa.gov/" style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; " target="_blank"&gt;PlanetQuest&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; website which gives an atlas of the known extrasolar planets with some nice interactive displays. &amp;nbsp;See the excellent &lt;a href="http://exoplanets.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Exoplanets Orbit Database&lt;/a&gt; (maintained by Penn State Professor Jason Wright and his advisees)&amp;nbsp;and the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://exoplanet.eu/" style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; font-weight: bold; " target="_blank"&gt;Extrasolar Planets Encyclopaedia&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;for details on each known planet. &amp;nbsp; These have interactive data tools that can be used to make&amp;nbsp;histogram and correlation plots such as those show in some of the online lectures. &amp;nbsp;These catalog list thousands of planets and planetary systems, and&amp;nbsp;the numbers continue to grow during the course of the semester. &amp;nbsp;You may&amp;nbsp;notice that the number of exoplanets on each site doesn't match exactly. &amp;nbsp;There are a variety of reasons, ranging from which site was updated most recently to the curators making different judgements about which planets should be included.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Michael Perryman has been a leading figure in the European Space Agency's efforts to find planets around other stars. &amp;nbsp;He is also author of a major advanced text in the field.&amp;nbsp; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://luth7.obspm.fr/20150708-macp-detection-methods.pdf" onclick="window.open(this.href, '', 'resizable=yes,status=no,location=no,toolbar=no,menubar=no,fullscreen=no,scrollbars=no,dependent=no'); return false;"&gt;His diagram&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, now a few years out of date, &amp;nbsp;summarizes the success of different methods for finding planets. The different branches of the tree show different methods. &amp;nbsp;The depth of the tree downwards indicates how sensitive the method is for discovering smaller planets. &amp;nbsp;On the axis on the left side, M&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt; refers to one Jupiter mass and M&lt;sub&gt;O&lt;/sub&gt; (circle with a plus inside) refers to one Earth mass. &amp;nbsp;Numbers at the bottom indicates how many planets or multiple-planet systems had been found with each method (as of 2015). &amp;nbsp;Dotted lines indicate technologies under development but not yet achieved. I suggest that you come back to this summary after you have studied about the various methods this week.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</body>

    <title>Direct Imaging Method</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;In a regular telescope, the image of a star is blurred by fluctuations in Earth's upper atmosphere by about 1 arcsecond. Except for the very nearest stars, the faint light from any orbiting planets will lie within this bright blur, and thus be undetectable. &amp;nbsp;Several technologies have (or still are) emerged in recent years to improve this situation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptive_optics" target="_blank"&gt;Adaptive optics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; is a complicated process whereby a flexible glass mirror in the telescope's optics is rapidly deformed (bent) to compensate for the atmospheric fluctuations. &amp;nbsp;This greatly improves the effective focus of the image.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronograph" target="_blank"&gt;coronograph&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is introduced into the optical system of the camera, placing an opaque dot on the star image. This allows faint light from orbiting planets to be see without the glare of the host star.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interferometry" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interferometry&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is a sophisticated technique whereby the star is imaged by two closely-space telescopes, and the signal is processed to "null" (essentially, erase) the stellar image, leaving faint emission from any planets. &amp;nbsp;A $1 billion &lt;a href="http://science.nasa.gov/missions/sim/" target="_blank"&gt;NASA space mission&lt;/a&gt; was under development using this technique, but has been cancelled due to technical difficulties and cost overruns.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These methods have been successful in detecting&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/?f=%22imaging%22+IN+detection" target="_blank"&gt;several dozen planets&lt;/a&gt; around other stars. &amp;nbsp;This method can only find planets that are quite distant from the star, typically 20-100 AU (Astronomical Unit = Earth-Sun distance). &amp;nbsp;The most remarkable case is HR 8799, a nearby star with about 2 solar masses and 4 orbiting planets ... over years, we have direct images that show the planets orbiting the star! &amp;nbsp;These planets have been imaged&amp;nbsp;both with NASA's Hubble Space Telescope in space and with active optics coronagraphs on mountaintop telescopes. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Astrometry Method</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;This topic is briefly covered in section 6.6.1. &amp;nbsp;Again, we don't need to know the mathematical details.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a planet orbits a star, the star orbits the planet! &amp;nbsp;Or, as Isaac Newton showed in his masterful work on the dynamics (motions and forces) of massive objects, both the planet and the star orbit the `center of mass' of the system. &amp;nbsp;Since the star is much more massive than the planet (our Sun is ~thousand times more massivethan Jupiter, and ~million time more than Earth), the star's motion is very small compared to the size of the planet's orbit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align: center; "&gt;&lt;a href="http://spheroid.files.wordpress.com/2007/02/astrometry.jpg?w=500" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img alt="Diagram of a star's motion around the center of mass due to the gravitational pull of a planet. (Not to scale: the star's motion is actually much smaller than shown)" class="lightbox" src="http://spheroid.files.wordpress.com/2007/02/astrometry.jpg?w=500" style="width: 30%;"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align: left; "&gt;If several planets are present, then they each pull the star in different directions at different orbital periods, giving rise to a complicated wobble pattern that would tell a good deal about the planetary system. &amp;nbsp;Here is how the Sun would look if its position could be accurately monitored&amp;nbsp;from another star:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0c/Solar_system_barycenter.svg/500px-Solar_system_barycenter.svg.png" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img alt="Motion of the Sun when viewed from above the plane of the Solar System" class="lightbox" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0c/Solar_system_barycenter.svg/500px-Solar_system_barycenter.svg.png" style="width: 40%;"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learn more about the Sun's wobble with the interactive applet &lt;a href="http://astro.unl.edu/classaction/animations/extrasolarplanets/ca_extrasolarplanets_starwobble.html" target="_blank"&gt;at the UNL's star wobble website&lt;/a&gt;. What planets have the greatest dynamical effect on the Sun?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, a quantitative evaluation of this effect shows it is extremely small. &amp;nbsp;If the Sun were viewed from a star 10 parcsec distant and that is a very close star), then the maximum wobble is only about 1/1000 of an arcsecond. &amp;nbsp;Even the most accurate telescope available today cannot achieve this accuracy in the visible or infrared band. &amp;nbsp;It is there not a surprise that no planets have yet been discovered due to the &amp;nbsp;astrometric wobble of the host star.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align: left; "&gt;This situation is expected to change in a few years with the arrival of data from the&amp;nbsp;"GAIA" mission led by the European Space Agency (ESA).&amp;nbsp;From space, beyond the distorting effects of Earth's atmosphere, the mission will be able to measure the positions of 1 billion stars in our Galaxy to micro-arcsecond precision, far beyond the capabilities of the best ground-based observatories. It is expected that GAIA will thus detect many massive planets via the astrometric motions of their host stars; however, its precision is not sufficient to promise detection of Earth-like planets in the habitable zones of (most of) these stars.&lt;/div&gt;</body>

    <title>Radial Velocity Method</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This topic is treated in detail in our text, sec 6.6.2. &amp;nbsp;Fig 6.18 shows the first detected exoplanetary signal in the spectrum of the solar-like star 51 Pegasi. &amp;nbsp;But we will not be responsible for the full mathematical treatment in the text. &amp;nbsp;It is useful to look it over: for example, equation (6.20) shows how the orbit size (a&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;) can be established from the orbital period and the mass of the host star, and equation (6.24) shows how the mass of the planet (M&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;) can be estimated from the maximum Doppler velocity of the star, its mass, and the orbit size. &amp;nbsp; But we don't have to learn all of the mathematical details. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most successful technique for detection and confirmation of planets has been via the small, periodic (repeating) alternating Doppler redshifts and blueshifts in the star's light which indicate it is being pushed and pulled by an unseen planet. Swiss astronomers Michel Mayor and Didier Queloz (see Fig. 7.1 on page 233) made the first discovery of a planet around a Sun-like star in 1995 with their detection of a periodic wobble in the motions of the star 51 Pegasi. Since then, they and other groups have found several hundred&amp;nbsp;planets via the Doppler wobbles of Sun-like stars due to their orbiting planets. &amp;nbsp;As of October 2016,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://exoplanets.org/table" target="_blank"&gt;Exoplanets Data Explorer&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;(set the "Filter" to say "PLANETDISCMETH == 'RV' ") lists 482 planets, while&amp;nbsp;the catalog at the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://exoplanet.eu/catalog.php" style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; " target="_blank"&gt;Extrasolar Planets Encyclopedia&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;lists over 600.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Doppler effect is illustrated in the first diagram below. The unseen planet orbits the visible star, which undergoes a small blueshift (motion towards us) when the planet is receding, and a small redshift (motion away from us) when the planet is approaching. &amp;nbsp;The second image below shows the complicated visible band spectrum of a Sun-like star showing the many absorption lines that shift blueward and redward as the planet orbits the star. &amp;nbsp;Tthe Dopper shifts are smaller than 1-part-in-a-million, so the shifts are smaller than the width of a line. &amp;nbsp;The best spectrograph today, built specially for planet detection, can detect stellar motions as small as 1 meter/sec (walking speed), or a few billionths of the rest wavelength of the absorption line. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; text-align: left; "&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; text-align: center; "&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;The astronomer takes the spectrum of a star over and over again -- for weeks, months and years -- &amp;nbsp;hoping to find some variation in the radial velocity. &amp;nbsp;If a variation is found, then mathematical tools are used to search for the orbital period which can range from days to years. &amp;nbsp;The radial velocity data are `folded' modulo this period and replotted like the following graph. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align: left; "&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align: center; "&gt;&lt;a href="/_legacy/astro140/hd99492b.gif" style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; " target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img alt="A typical stellar radial velocity variations due to an orbiting planet" class="lightbox" src="/_legacy/astro140/hd99492b.gif" style="cursor: default; border-width: 0px; width: 364px;"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case, the star exhibits a +10 to -10 meter/s motion with the planet's orbital period of 17 days. &amp;nbsp;The shape of the curve gives the eccentricity of the system; a pure sine wave indicates a perfectly circular orbit. &amp;nbsp;A calculation based on Newton's Laws of Motion and Gravity allow the mass of the planet to be estimated; here it about 0.11 times the mass of Jupiter. &amp;nbsp;So, we have a case here of a `hot Nepture' orbiting closer to the star than Mercury orbits our Sun (Mercury's orbital period is about 3 months, greater than 17 days). &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; text-align: left; "&gt;In some cases, the wobble is complicated because several planets with different orbital periods pull on the star; there are known cases where 3, 4, and even possibly 6 planets have been found to orbit a single star using radial velocity techniques. &amp;nbsp;A famous example is the bright star Upsilon Andromedae that has three planets in orbits similar to the terrestrial planets in our Solar System ... but the planets are much more massive!&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Transit and Transit Timing Methods</title>
    <body>&lt;h2&gt;Planetary Transit Method&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;This topic is covered in section 6.4, rather briefly considering its great importance today. &amp;nbsp;Here the math is easy: equation (6.9) shows that the radius of the planet (R&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;) divided by the radius of the host star (R&lt;sub&gt;*&lt;/sub&gt;) can be easily measured from the fraction of starlight obscured during the transit. &amp;nbsp;Figure 6.11 shows recent data on the first planetary transit discovered around star HD 209458.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a planet's orbit happens, by chance, to be aligned along the line-of-sight between Earth and the host star, then the planet's disk will pass in front of the star's disk and eclipse a tiny fraction of the starlight. &amp;nbsp;This is called the&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;transit&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;of a planet across the star. &amp;nbsp;The phenomenon has been well-known for centuries because, every few years, Venus transits across the Sun's disk as seen from Earth. &amp;nbsp;This was historically important because it allowed accurate measurement of the Earth-Sun distance in the 1700-1800s. &amp;nbsp;The latest transit of Venus took place last summer, June 5-6 2012, and was visible to U.S. amateur astronomers with telescopes equipped to image the sun. The next transit is in 2117, but you can see a &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z9rM8ChTjY" target="_blank"&gt;NASA movie of the transit&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The diagrams below illustrate the phenomena involving a planet orbiting another star. &amp;nbsp;The starlight brightness dims slightly when the planet transits; this dip is typically 0.01-1% of the light, so the brightness measurements must be very accurate. &amp;nbsp;This is best achieved using a telescope on a satellite in space where the shimmering of our atmosphere is not present. &amp;nbsp;If the orbital speed of the planet is known from radial velocity measurements, its radius can be directly measured by the duration of the eclipse ingress and egress (the short tilted lines in the brightness diagrams below).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

As we will see in coming lectures, the Kepler mission has revolutionized planet detection with several thousand&amp;nbsp;candidate planets. Today, most of the planets known&amp;nbsp;were identified by the Kepler mission. &amp;nbsp;Most of the planets it finds are in planetary systems having multiple planets, and many of the systems exhibiting remarkable properties.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Transit Timing Method&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a planet is observed to transit its host star, it will transit the star every orbit, in a highly predictable fashion. In fact, the transits will follow one another with absolutely clock-like regularity...&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;unless&lt;/strong&gt; the planet's orbital motions are being perturbed by the gravitational influence of other planets in the system. In the latter case, we can expect to observe&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;transit timing variations&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;- subtle drifting of the transit times, compared to an exactly periodic signal - which will (in time) reveal the mass and orbit of the perturbing planet. This entirely different method of planet discovery has been maturing at a furious rate thanks to the continuing observations of the &lt;strong&gt;Kepler&lt;/strong&gt; mission, which not only detects planets in transit, but also continues to observe them as they transit their host star, over and over again. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Penn State&amp;nbsp;Professor Eric Ford was a member of the Kepler Science team and&amp;nbsp;one of the leaders of studying multiple-planet systems with transit timing variations. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rqQ1xKsNIQE" width="640"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

    <title>Microlensing Method</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This topic is covered in our text's section 6.5, and again we don't cover the mathematics.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a massive body &amp;nbsp;passes in front of a luminous object (like another star) as seen from Earth, then the background starlight can be focussed and amplified by the intervening body. This process in known as `microlensing', a type of `gravitational lensing' that was known by Albert Einstein a century ago. As the foreground star passes slowly in front of the background star, the brightness of the background star shows a slow rise and fall in brightness, typically lasting several weeks. But if the foreground star also has one or more planets in a fortuitous orbital location, then the planet also causes a lensing event, but much quicker. See the diagram&amp;nbsp;below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center; "&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/images/content/57826main_microlensing-browse.jpg" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img alt="Diagram of the microlensing of a background `source' star by a foreground `lens' star that has a planet" class="lightbox" src="http://www.nasa.gov/images/content/57826main_microlensing-browse.jpg" style="width: 50%;"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: left; "&gt;Perhaps the most remarkable system found so far using gravitational microlensing is named &lt;a href="http://www.astronomy.ohio-state.edu/~microfun/ob06109/" target="_blank"&gt;OGLE-2006-BLG-109&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;nbsp;Its weird brightness variations are modeled by planets very similar to our Solar System: a Jupiter-mass planet and a Saturn-mass planet at distances 2 and 4 AU. &amp;nbsp;Here is the brightness variation seen in 2006. &amp;nbsp;Once the event was triggered, telescopes around the world (New Zealand, Australia, Israel, Canary Islands,&amp;nbsp;Chile, United States) observed the star nearly continuously for ~10 days. &amp;nbsp;This was essential to capture the complexity of the event, and thus model the planetary system. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>General Properties of Exoplanets</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;Let us now look at some of the collective properties of planetary systems known today, keeping in mind that these are small and biased samples. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Results from Radial Velocity Surveys&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Radial velocity surveys have various limitations, but they can find planetary systems with reasonable reliability when the planet's gravitional pull is sufficiently strong; &amp;nbsp;that is, the planet's mass can't be too small and its orbital period can not too long. &amp;nbsp;In particular, expect the radial velocity surveys to undercount the lower mass planets ... they are particularly good at finding the more massive gaseous (Jupiter-like) planets. &amp;nbsp;Using Newton's version of Kepler's Third Law of Planetary Orbits, we can estimate the mass of these planets ... but we don't get their radius. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following diagrams have been extensively discussed as important summaries of the radial velocity surveys. &amp;nbsp;The first one plots&amp;nbsp;the planetary mass in units of Jupiter's mass&amp;nbsp;against the semi-major axis (i.e. radius for a circular orbit)&amp;nbsp;in Astronomical Units.&amp;nbsp; We use logarithmic units because the range of the variables is very large; so the masses range from around 0.001 M&lt;sub&gt;Jup&lt;/sub&gt; (1e-3) to 100 M&lt;sub&gt;Jup&lt;/sub&gt; (1e+2). &amp;nbsp;The second diagram plots the orbit's eccentricity (where 0 is a circular orbit and 0.9 is highly elongated) against the semi-major axis. It is useful to remember where Earth lies on these&amp;nbsp;plots: it has mass = 0.003&amp;nbsp;M&lt;sub&gt;Jup&lt;/sub&gt;, radius = 0.09 R&lt;sub&gt;Jup&lt;/sub&gt;, semi-major axis = 1.0 AU, and eccentricity near 0.0.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=1889|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__lightboxed]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=1890|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__lightboxed]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first plot seems to show three distinct groups:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li style="text-align: left; "&gt;Starting on the left side, we see planets with roughly Jupiter's mass and very small orbits, a few percent of an AU. &amp;nbsp;These planets&amp;nbsp;orbit their host stars in a few days, rather than in a few years as we seen in our Solar System. &amp;nbsp;51 Peg b, the first clearly detected planet (1995), is one of these planets. &amp;nbsp;These are nicknamed&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;hot Jupiters&lt;/strong&gt;, because they low so close to their host stars; indeed, in a few cases, we see spectroscopic evidence that the gases from the planet's atmosphere are being heated and flow away from the host star. &amp;nbsp;But we need to explain how these planets got their tiny orbits considering that Jupiters are expected to form in the outer parts of protoplanetary disks.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li style="text-align: left; "&gt;We then see a &amp;nbsp;group of planets with masses around 0.03 M&lt;sub&gt;Jup&lt;/sub&gt; ~ 10 M&lt;sub&gt;Earth&lt;/sub&gt; with orbit sizes around 0.1 AU. &amp;nbsp;These were found relatively recently using the most accurate spectrographs; then are nicknamed&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;super-Earths.&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;In most cases, they lie too close to the host star to be in the Habitable Zones, so they are hot ... in some cases, the surface may be molten rock!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li style="text-align: left; "&gt;A considerable number of radial velocity planets have masses several times Jupiter and orbit sizes of several AU. &amp;nbsp;Clearly, our Jupiter is a rather modest planet among the gaseous giants orbiting other planets.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: left; "&gt;The second diagram above shows that many planets have very eccentric (elliptical) orbits. &amp;nbsp; This was a big surprise! &amp;nbsp;In our Solar System, planet orbits are nearly circular (eccentricities&amp;nbsp;mostly&amp;nbsp;less than that 0.05). &amp;nbsp;In the early years around 1995-2000, we found mostly&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;eccentric Jupiters, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;but today with more sensitive spectrographs, we see eccentric super-Earths too. &amp;nbsp;This raises a big question:&amp;nbsp;how did these planets got high eccentricities considering that they formed in protoplanetary disks where the orbits should be nearly perfectly circular.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: left; "&gt;If we count the number of planets found with radial velocity surveys against the number of stars that were observed, we found that at least 10% of all Sun-like stars examined show radial velocity signatures of Jovian planets. &amp;nbsp;And there are probably many more stars with less massive&amp;nbsp;planets that cannot be detected in this fashion. &amp;nbsp;But by this method alone, we predict that (for a trillion stars in our Galaxy) there will be tens-to-hundreds of billions of planets in our Galaxy. &amp;nbsp;Wow! &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: left; "&gt;A major lesson from both diagrams is that few systems resemble our Solar System. &amp;nbsp;The terrestrial planets (Mercury through Mars) would not be detectable using radial velocity methods, so our Solar System would show only two planets on these graphs:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Jupiter (1 M&lt;sub&gt;Jup&lt;/sub&gt; mass at 5 AU semi-major axis and 5% eccentricity), and Saturn (0.3 M&lt;sub&gt;Jup&lt;/sub&gt; at 10 A.U. and 6% eccentricity). It is not yet clear whether our Solar&amp;nbsp;System has a rare configuration of planets, or whether better surveys will find many Solar System analogs. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Results from Transiting Planets&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Kepler survey is, by far, the best source of transiting planets. &amp;nbsp;Kepler has detected over 8,000 probable planetary systems of which &gt;1000 are `confirmed' with additional spectroscopic evidence. &amp;nbsp;But it is widely believed that &gt;90% of the Kepler `probable' planets are real, and that many more planetary transits are hidden by brightness variations in the host star. &amp;nbsp;That is why you are participating in the PlanetHunters citizen science effor&amp;nbsp;to find new transits within variable light curves! &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The computer-generated poster below shows the host stars (with realistic surface colors) and small black dots to representing the sizes of the transiting planet.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center; "&gt;&lt;a href="/_legacy/astro140/candidates_rowe_front792px.jpg" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img alt="A visualization of the planet candidates from Kepler mission, as of December 2011" class="lightbox" src="/_legacy/astro140/candidates_rowe_front792px.jpg" style="width: 600px; height: 928px;"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plot below compares the radii of Kepler planets (in units of R&lt;sub&gt;Jup&lt;/sub&gt;, Jupiter's radius) to their orbit size (in units of AU, the Earth-Sun distance). &amp;nbsp;Recall that the transit method can give the planet's radius (by timing the ingress/egress of the transit lightcurve) but not the planet's mass or eccentricity. &amp;nbsp;&lt;img alt="" src="https://courses.ed.science.psu.edu/astro140/sites/courses/ed/astro140/files/mooc_images/a-vs-r.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;We clearly see again a clump of Jupiter-like planets (R~1-2 R&lt;sub&gt;Jup&lt;/sub&gt;) with very small orbits (a~0.02-0.06 AU). &amp;nbsp;These are the&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;hot Jupiters&lt;/strong&gt; that we saw in the radial velocity surveys above.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Most of the planets have sizes between ~0.07 and ~0.4 R&lt;sub&gt;Jup&lt;/sub&gt;. &amp;nbsp;For comparison, in our Solar System Neptune has radius 0.35 R&lt;sub&gt;Jup&lt;/sub&gt; and Earth has radius 0.09 R&lt;sub&gt;Jup&lt;/sub&gt;. &amp;nbsp;So these exoplanets are often called&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Neptunes, super-Earths,&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;and&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Earths. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;Note however the tilt in the lower envelope of the Kepler planets in this diagram. This is an instrumental limitation: transits of very small planets orbiting far from the star produce transits too faint for the Kepler detectors to see. &amp;nbsp;Thus there are only a couple (out of thousands) of Kepler exoplanets that are &lt;b&gt;Earth twins&lt;/b&gt; with radius ~0.09 R&lt;sub&gt;Jup&lt;/sub&gt; and orbit ~1 AU. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Kepler Team has performed a final re-analysis of its data, and the latest list of Kepler planetary candidates should be announced in 2006 (possibly during our semester). &amp;nbsp;Below is a histogram of&amp;nbsp;planet radii shown by the Kepler Team at&amp;nbsp;conferences from their earlier analysis. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The most common planets found are super-Earths and Neptunes, and Jupiters are much rarer. &amp;nbsp;Earths (and sub-Earths??) are probably much more numerous than found due to instrumental limitations.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Multiplanet Systems</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;Hundreds of the exoplanets -- from transit, radial velocity, microlensing and direct imaging surveys -- &amp;nbsp;are in multiple planet systems. &amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Watch the totally fun animation of all known Kepler multiple planet systems below. &amp;nbsp;This is a winner!! &amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this class, we select a few of the fascinating exoplanetary systems that have been characterized in some detail. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Upsilon Andromedae&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was the first exciting multiplanetary system, discovered during 1996-1999 with the&amp;nbsp;radial velocity method. &amp;nbsp;Below is a diagram of the orbits (with Mercury, Venus and Earth shown with dashed orbits), and an artist's view of the planets. &amp;nbsp;This system illustrates two common phenomena not seen in our Solar System: &amp;nbsp;a "hot Jupiter" orbiting extremely close to the host star (ups And b, 4.6 day orbit); and orbital that are more eccentric than the near-circular orbits in our Solar System. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

The most famous case is HR 8799 in the image below. The bright central star has been suppressed and three planets are revealed.

&lt;h2&gt;Kepler 11 bcdefg&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is one of the most spectacular planetary systems to emerge from NASA's Kepler satellite's monitoring of ~160,000 stars: 6 planets orbiting a Sun-like star. &amp;nbsp;The top diagram shows the data: &amp;nbsp;brightness (vertical axis showing the star's brightness measured with incredible accuracy of around 0.01%) plotted against time (horizontal axis, showing ~1.5 years of monitoring). &amp;nbsp;Dozens of tiny dips are seen in the star's brightness that are modeled as the transits of 6 planets (second and third panel below). &amp;nbsp;These planets are `super-Earths' and `Neptunes' with masses around 3-20 Earth masses. &amp;nbsp;All of them orbit close to the host star, too hot to be in the star's Habitable Zone. The planets' radii, measured from the ingress/egress times of the transit eclipses, are consistent with densities around 0.5-2 g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. &amp;nbsp;This suggests they are made mostly of gases rather than solid rock. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Exoplanet Composition</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;While it is possible in a few cases, with great difficulty, to obtain spectra of the atmospheres of exoplanets, we do have a crude measure of &lt;strong&gt;planet composition&lt;/strong&gt; for some dozens of exoplanets. &amp;nbsp;This comes from the &lt;strong&gt;density&lt;/strong&gt; of the planet: &amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Density = Mass / Volume&lt;/strong&gt; = Mass / (4/3 pi) Radius&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;for a sphere. &amp;nbsp;A trivial example might be: a pound of feathers occupies a much larger volume than a pound of steel, so steel has a much higher density than feathers. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a planet is detected both using the radial velocity method (which gives a measurement of the mass) and the transit method (which gives a measurement of the radius), we can combine these to estimate the density. &amp;nbsp;A gas giant planet will have low density below 1 g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;(one gram per cubic centimeter). &amp;nbsp;A planet of solid water ice will have density at 1 g/cm^3. &amp;nbsp;Solid rocky (silicate) planets should have densities around 3-4 g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. &amp;nbsp; A pure iron planet would have density around 8 g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. &amp;nbsp;So we have a real ability to evaluate something about the composition of planets without actually measuring their spectrum. &amp;nbsp;See the artist's drawing below for predictions of different planet compositions.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Protoplanetary Disks</title>

&lt;div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The discovery of protoplanetary disks around young stars&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After Isaac Newton explained the motions of planets in our Solar System using his Laws of Motion and Gravity, scholars tried to explain how our planetary system might have originated.&amp;nbsp; The model that proved successful was envisioned by Immanuel Kant in a book&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://records.viu.ca/%7Ejohnstoi/kant/kant2e.htm" style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; " target="_blank"&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration: underline; "&gt;Universal Natural History (1755)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;; he later became famous as a philosopher (rather than a scientist).&amp;nbsp; Kant proposed that our Solar System condensed out of a gaseous disk orbiting the Sun, long ago. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Immanuel Kant's model for the Solar System was largely forgotten for many years, and astrophysicists thought about star formation mainly with a simplistic spherical model.&amp;nbsp; Here gas and dust in interstellar clouds undergo gravitational collapse, falling directly into the core where a star forms.&amp;nbsp; We thus expected protostars to be enshrouded in a spherical envelope of dust and gas.&amp;nbsp; This envelope has, in fact, recently been seen using millimeter telescopes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the flattened structure orbiting the protostar, the protoplanetary disk where planets can form, eluded detection until the 1980-90s.&amp;nbsp; Three steps can be traced in their discovery and study:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. &lt;strong&gt;IRAS (InfraRed Astronomical Satellite)&lt;/strong&gt; detected strong infrared emission around young stars. IRAS was a collaboration between NASA, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands in the 1980s. &amp;nbsp; Infrared astronomy had been in a very primitive state due to the difficulty of designing sensitive detectors and the infrared brightness of the Earth's atmosphere, even during nighttime. &amp;nbsp; When the first infrared telescope was launched into space, it found that some stars had tens, hundreds or thousands of times more infrared emission than expected.&amp;nbsp; The excess was found in intermediate-mass stars like Vega, and in young stars in molecular clouds.&amp;nbsp; The best explanation was a flattened disk of dusty gas at temperatures around T ~ 100-500 K (degrees Kelvin, the Earth's surface is at T=300K).&amp;nbsp; However, &lt;strong&gt;the IRAS telescope detected the infrared emission from the disks&lt;/strong&gt;, it did not focus well enough to image the disk, and did not have high spectral resolution to study the composition of the disks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. In the early 1990s, &lt;strong&gt;NASA's Hubble Space Telescope&lt;/strong&gt; observed some these nearby young stars and clearly imaged the disks.&amp;nbsp; Three types are shown below:&amp;nbsp; the AB Auriga and HD 141569 disks are seen in reflected starlight; several disks around protostars in the nearby Taurus molecular cloud are seen in silhouette against the illuminated gas above and below the disk; and disks around young stars in the Orion Nebula Cluster are seen in silhouette against the bright emission behind the stars.&amp;nbsp; &lt;strong&gt;These were the first time astronomers directly saw the protoplanetary disks where planets form. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

In the mid-2000s,&amp;nbsp; &lt;strong&gt;NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope&lt;/strong&gt; observed hundreds of protoplanetary disks.&amp;nbsp; Spitzer still could not focus well-enough to image the disks, but had an excellent &lt;strong&gt;infrared spectrometer&lt;/strong&gt; to obtain detailed spectra of the protoplanetary disks.&amp;nbsp; Three examples are shown below.&amp;nbsp; The AA Tau disk shows water (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), hydrogen cyanide (HCN), and acetylene (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).&amp;nbsp; The HH 46 disk shows ices (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, and alcohol CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;OH), gas (CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;methane), and rock (silicates).&amp;nbsp; The CRBR 2422.8-3423 disk shows gasses (CO, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) , rock (silicates), and ices (water). &lt;strong&gt;Spitzer thus showed the composition of disks are closely related to the composition of planets.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Planet formation and the early Solar System</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Having found protoplanetary disks orbiting virtually all young stars, we now have to figure out how planets form in these disks. &amp;nbsp;Planet formation is still incompletely understood ... many physical processes seem to be involved, and astrophysicists are struggling today to put them all together in a coherent fashion. &amp;nbsp;Much insight, however, is obtained by studying ancient bodies in our Solar System. &amp;nbsp;Earth and the other planets have erased their origins, but the small rocky bodies from the Asteroid Belt, a few of which have landed on Earth as meteorites, provide essential clues. &amp;nbsp;So we model the origin of our own Solar System, and adapt that model to explain exoplanetary systems.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; font-weight: normal; font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 17px; "&gt;Origin of our Solar System&lt;/h3&gt;

When the bodies become sufficient large (roughly kilometer size), then gravitational focusing becomes important. &amp;nbsp;The&amp;nbsp;larger planetisimals grow faster, sweeping all of the rock in a ring around the Sun. After tens of millions of years, only a few large, well-separated protoplanets are left. &amp;nbsp;Other small bodies are scattered to outer eccentric orbits, as we see today in the Kuiper Belt and Oort Cloud where most comets reside.&amp;nbsp; The few very largest bodies attract hydrogen and other gas … these become the giant gas planets like Jupiter. &amp;nbsp;Others remain rocky like Earth and Mars, with a bit of atmosphere from the volatile molecules (like water, methane, ammonia, and carbon dioxide) that was originally in the interstellar dust. &amp;nbsp;This planet formation scenario is called the&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;core accretion model. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Explaining hot and eccentric Jupiters</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Having established a reasonable model for how our Solar System emerged from its protoplanetary disk, we now see what changes are needed for exoplanetary systems. &amp;nbsp;Two topics are nicely understood: the origin of `hot Jupiters', and the origin of `eccentric Jupiters'. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;The hot Jupiter issue is discussed in more detail in our text, An Introduction to Astrobiology, Chpt. 7.3. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Other issues are still under study and debate; for example, of all the gas giants undergo inward migration, then there should not be any terrestrial planets in the Habitable Zones!&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; font-weight: normal; font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 17px; "&gt;Planet Migration - Hot Jupiters (Chpt 7.3)&lt;/h3&gt;

But we have found that many of the exoplanetary systems discovered in Doppler (radial velocity) searches have Jupiters in high-eccentricity, inclined orbits. Fortunately, astrophysicists quickly found a convincing explanation for these eccentric Jupiters.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top: 0.6em; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.2em; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; "&gt;When two or three proto-Jupiters form in a protoplanetary disk and start to migrate, their gravitational interactions can easily become resonant and unstable, as when one planet orbits at half the period of the other (we encountered this phenomenon earlier, with the four major moons of Jupiter). Unstable orbital interactions can easily lead to a cataclysmic realignment of the planets' orbits. From simulations of such systems, theorists find that a frequent outcome is for one of the gas giants to collide with the host star or be ejected from the planetary system; at the same time, the remaining gas giant acquires a high-eccentricity orbit. As most of the planetary systems found so far with Doppler searches have eccentric Jupiter-mass planets, this appears to be a common occurrence, with a relatively small minority of planetary systems having their Jupiters in nearly-circular orbits as in our Solar System.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

Specifically, the gravitational interaction of two gas giant planets - for example, our Jupiter and Saturn - can act to halt or even reverse the inward migration of the inner planet (Jupiter, in our case), holding it in place until the protoplanetary disk has dissipated, and all of the protoplanetary objects are either ejected from the system, or incorporated into a planet. Once the disk is dissipated, the forces of planetary migration stop, and planetary orbits are generally stable for the very long term (&gt; Ga).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

As this movie progresses also watch the water shown in blue; water from icy planetisimals can impact the inner planets giving oceans on rocky planets near the Habitable Zone. It is still not clear why some Jupiters spiral in while others don't, and under what conditions inner rocky planets can survive.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</body>

    <title>Conclusions: Exoplanets in the Galaxy</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Astronomers have made remarkable progress in discovering and characterizing exoplanets and the disks from which they emerged. &amp;nbsp;Astrophysicists are making significant progress in modeling the processes of planet formation and planetary system evolution, although major questions still remain. &amp;nbsp;Overall, from the 1980s to the present day, astronomy has laid an empirical foundation for the argument that the conditions for life are prevalent throughout the Galaxy. &amp;nbsp;This is a remarkable scientific achievement. &amp;nbsp; Here is an outline of what we have learned.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this foundation in empirical astronomical findings, we now turn to Theme V of the course where we ask more speculative questions: Could there be living organisms on these other planets? &amp;nbsp;Could such organisms be intelligent, even more advanced technologically than us? &amp;nbsp;Could such aliens have visited us, or could we visit them in the future? &amp;nbsp;Could there be a Galactic-wide civilization? &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Theme V: Life Around Other Stars</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;We have established quite a lot about the possibilities of extraterrestrial life:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Most stars are born with protoplanetary disks, many of these produce planetary systems (e.g. the extrasolar planets found from Doppler wobble and transits), and some of these quite reasonably produce planets in the habitable zone (i.e. liquid water).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The molecular clouds and protoplanetary disks have molecules that lie at the foundation of terrestrial life: H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and a variety of small carbon based molecules (e.g. acids, alcohols, hydrocarbons)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The biochemistry of terrestrial life constructs carbon-based macromolecules from these ingredients (cellulose, proteins, DNA) from which a remarkable variety of organisms living in a wide range of environments (extremophiles in ocean vents, hot volcanic springs, in rock, in ice) have developed (archaea, bacteria, fleas, chimpanzees and humans).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The formation of the first life forms on Earth -- the leap from small molecules to self-reproducing macromolecules -- is not yet understood. &amp;nbsp;But the evolution of increasingly complex and diverse life forms from simpler ones is well-understood.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A wide diversity of sophisticated lifeforms exists on Earth, but there is no advanced life elsewhere in the Solar System, although there is a possibility of primitive (e.g. archaea-type) life on Mars or Jovian moons such as Europa &amp; Titan. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In the past half-century, humans have demonstrated the ability to send robotic probes throughout the Solar System, though not to other stars. &amp;nbsp;These probes undoubtedly have terrestrial microbes, and thus conceivably could bring terrestrial life to other worlds. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Based on these findings, during Theme V of the course, we ask questions like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="margin-left: 40px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;What are the possibilities of &lt;span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;"&gt;intelligent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;life on habitable planets orbiting other stars?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What are the possibilities of us &lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;communicating&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt; with them (or vice versa) using light?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What are the possibilities of us &lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;traveling&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt; to them (or vice versa) using space ships?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Has such interstellar travel &lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;yet occurred&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;?&amp;nbsp; Can we become a space-faring civilization? Have we been visited by aliens?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Can there be a &lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Galaxy-wide civilization&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; with closely linked societies on many habitable planets?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What is the&amp;nbsp;&lt;span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold; "&gt;meaning and context&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;of life in the Universe, both from a cultural viewpoint and from a modern cosmological viewpoint? &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Drake Equation: How many aliens are out there?</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;In 1961, astronomer Frank Drake developed a formula to estimate the number of intelligent species or communicable civilizations in our Galaxy that we could communicate with at this instant of time. The Drake Equation is not a real physical equation (like Newton's equations of motion and gravity), but it is a useful way to organize our knowledge and thoughts regarding the number of cummunicable civilizations in the Galaxy. &amp;nbsp;We will see that reasonable estimates range from 1 (only us) to 10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;strong&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;nbsp;= N&lt;sub&gt;*&lt;/sub&gt; x f&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt; x N&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; x f&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; x f&lt;sub&gt;l&lt;/sub&gt; x f&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; x L&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;/L&lt;sub&gt;MW&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Values need to be determined for each factor. Some can be calculated fairly easily, other are only rough guesses. A wide range of information is needed to determine N&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;strong&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;*&lt;/sub&gt; = Number of stars in the galaxy.&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;nbsp;Current estimates indicate that the mass of the Milky Way Galaxy is (except for distant Dark Matter) around 300 billion (3 x 10&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;) M&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;. &amp;nbsp;The most common star has M~0.3 M&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;. &amp;nbsp;We estimate there are roughly 300 billion (3 x 10&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;) to a&amp;nbsp;trillion (1 x 10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;) stars in the Milky Way. &amp;nbsp; This is actually one of the best known terms in the Drake equation!&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;strong&gt;f&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt; = Fraction of these stars that can host habitable planets.&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;nbsp; The width of habitable zones depends critically on both the luminosity of the host star and the atmospheric conditions of the planet. &amp;nbsp;High mass stars (OBAF) may evolve so fast that intelligent life would not have the time to develop (at least in a way similar to what happened on Earth). &amp;nbsp;However, these stars are rare. &amp;nbsp; M stars are most common, and some years ago there was concern that&amp;nbsp;a planet&amp;nbsp;in the habitable zone&amp;nbsp;of an M star would be uninhabitable due to tidal&amp;nbsp;locking&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;damaging stellar&amp;nbsp;flares. &amp;nbsp;But it is now widely considered that planets orbiting&amp;nbsp;M stars are reasonable hosts for life forms. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Stars in&amp;nbsp;binary systems with 0.1-40AU &amp;nbsp;separations will not permit planet on stable orbits in the habitable zone. &amp;nbsp; Combining all of these ideas, some astronomers might&amp;nbsp;estimate f&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;~0.5, while others might estimate f&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;~0.05, where differences stem largely from different ideas of what makes a star a good host for a habitable planet. &amp;nbsp; While this range may seem large, it turns out there will be much larger uncertainties later on. &amp;nbsp;Let's take a value of&amp;nbsp;f&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;~0.1 here.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;strong&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; = number of planets per star.&lt;/strong&gt; Our own solar system has ~8 planets plus lots of minor bodies. &amp;nbsp;Based on Kepler and microlensing&amp;nbsp;results, we now are have clear observational evidence that, averaged over all stars,&amp;nbsp;N&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;&gt;0.5. &amp;nbsp;Furthermore, a&amp;nbsp;substantial&amp;nbsp;fraction (10-30%) of planetary systems successfully detected with radial velocity, transit, or microlensing have multiple planets (2-7). But these our technologies are still limited: radial velocities can only detect heavier planets in closer orbits,&amp;nbsp;transit searches miss most planets because the orbits are not aligned correctly for the planet to pass in front of the star from our viewpoint, microlensing depends on rare chance alignments of foreground and background stars,&amp;nbsp;and so forth. So the true number of planets per host star must be higher. &amp;nbsp;Planet formation calculations (e.g. oligarchic growth of planetary embryos) suggest that the most common outcome is likely to be a few to several planets spaced somewhat&amp;nbsp;regularly&amp;nbsp;in a&amp;nbsp;configuration that is likely to be stable for billions of years. &amp;nbsp; Reasonable estimates might range from N&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;=1&amp;nbsp;to ~10 planets per star. &amp;nbsp;Let's take a value of 5 planets here.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;strong&gt;f&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; = Fraction of the above planets to have Earth-like conditions suitable for life.&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;nbsp;This restricts planets of interest to those with rocky compositions and nearly-circular orbits in the Habitable Zone where water is liquid. &amp;nbsp;The higher estimates of N&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; place most of the planets outside of the Habitable Zone, either too close (hot) or too far (cold). &amp;nbsp;Planetary mass and atmospheric composition play an important role in habitability, e.g. through the carbonate-silicate cycle. &amp;nbsp;In our own system, 1-2 out of 8 planets are suitable for life for extended periods (say, &gt;1 Gyr). &amp;nbsp;A handful of the thousands of known extrasolar planets fall within the Habitable Zone, though often with eccentric orbits. Using statistical extrapolation&amp;nbsp;from the Kepler mission sample, several researchers estimate that roughly 1-10% of sun-like stars have planets between 1 and 1.6 times the radius of&amp;nbsp;Earth&amp;nbsp;planets with orbital periods vaguely near the Habitable Zone. &amp;nbsp;However, there is worry that, although the temperature might allow surface&amp;nbsp;liquid water, the atmosphere may have been evaporated by the host star, or otherwise have a composition inhospitable to life. &amp;nbsp;Altogether, I suggest an&amp;nbsp;estimate around&amp;nbsp;f&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;~0.01-0.1; let's assume 0.02 here.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;strong&gt;f&lt;sub&gt;l&lt;/sub&gt; = Fraction of the above "suitable planets" that lead to the development of primitive&amp;nbsp;life forms. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;Miller-Urey experiments show&amp;nbsp;that biotic material (e.g.. amino acids, lipids) can arise in an environment like the early Earth. &amp;nbsp;Simple biotic material may also be brought in by infalling interstellar particles or comets. Life may take a wide variety of forms from sulfur metabolizing, deep-sea vent bacteria to oxygen-breathing animals. &amp;nbsp;Nonetheless, there has been no success in producing self-reproducing macromolecular systems in the laboratory, so the mechanism of life formation is still unknown and we can not&amp;nbsp;estimate its probability in a scientific or statistical way&amp;nbsp;yet. &amp;nbsp;The integrated probability over billions of years&amp;nbsp;and over an entire planet is unknown. &amp;nbsp;The probability of life getting started in a limited time or location might be very small. &amp;nbsp;Alternatively, the origin of life may be nearly inevitable under the right conditions. &amp;nbsp;In order to progress, let's&amp;nbsp;assume &lt;strong&gt;f&lt;sub&gt;l&lt;/sub&gt; =0.01&lt;/strong&gt;; that is, one-in-a-hundred&amp;nbsp;planets in the Habitable Zones actually develop simple&amp;nbsp;living organisms.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;f&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; = Fraction of the above planets with primitive life that develop advanced lifeforms, `communicating civilizations' that can communicate or travel between the stars. &amp;nbsp;This is a question of the efficiency of biological evolution. &amp;nbsp;We recall that, on Earth, only unicellular organisms existed&amp;nbsp;from around 3.0 to 0.5 Gyr before the present. &amp;nbsp;There were a variety of organisms (extremophiles, cyanobacteria, etc) but none were multicellular with different cell types. &amp;nbsp;That began only at the beginning of the Cambrian Era ~500 million years ago when sponges, jellyfish, worms, etc. began to develop. &amp;nbsp;We have little&amp;nbsp;understanding of the causes of the Cambrian Explosion, and no way to scientifically or statistical estimate the probability that advanced civilizations will arise from a hypothetical group of planets with life. &amp;nbsp;So this factor is nearly completely unknown. &amp;nbsp;In order to progress, let's guess&amp;nbsp;f&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.001; one in a thousand planets with simple life develop radio telescopes and space craft. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;strong&gt;L/L&lt;sub&gt;MW&lt;/sub&gt; = Lifetime of communicating civilization / Lifetime of Milky Way. &lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;The lifetime of the Milky Way with stars having sufficiently high metallicity for planet formation is ~10 Gyr (10&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt; yr). Our radio telescopes have been in existence less than ~10&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;years (since 1946). So on Earth today, this fraction is extremely small, ~10&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/10&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt; = 10&lt;sup&gt;-9&lt;/sup&gt;. &amp;nbsp;There is no scientific or statistical way to estimate a maximum to this value. &amp;nbsp; Earth has had&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;human-like mammals that can flexibly adapt their environments for a few million years. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;In order to progress, let's use this estimate and assume that advanced civilizations can last a million years, so&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;L/L&lt;sub&gt;MW&lt;/sub&gt; =&lt;/strong&gt;10&lt;sup&gt;-5&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;p&gt;OK, let's multiply:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;nbsp;= N&lt;sub&gt;*&lt;/sub&gt; x f&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt; x N&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; x f&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; x f&lt;sub&gt;l&lt;/sub&gt; x f&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; x L&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;/L&lt;sub&gt;MW&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;=&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;10&lt;sup&gt;12&amp;nbsp;&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;x 0.1 x 5 x 0.02 x 0.01 x&amp;nbsp;0.001 x 10&lt;sup&gt;-5&amp;nbsp;&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; =&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;0&amp;nbsp;&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;~ 1 to 10&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, we know there is at least one communicable civilization in the Galaxy today --&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;ourselves -- so a lower limit is&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; =1&lt;/strong&gt;. &amp;nbsp;Optimistic estimates for various factors could give&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;6&amp;nbsp;&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;or more. &amp;nbsp;A reasonable range is therefore&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;i&amp;nbsp;&lt;/sub&gt;= 10&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; - 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;div&gt;In summary, we know so little that&amp;nbsp;it is&amp;nbsp;not crazy to consider the possibility of&amp;nbsp;that thousands or millions&amp;nbsp;of intelligent civilizations are now alive in the Galaxy. &amp;nbsp;But if multiple terms in the Drake equation are quite small, then there might be only a few,or&amp;nbsp;we might be the only communicating civilization in the Milky Way today. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Similar discussions of the Drake Equation can be found in our textbook (section 6.1.1, less detailed than my treatment) and online at &lt;a href="http://www.activemind.com/Mysterious/Topics/SETI/drake_equation.html" target="_blank"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_equation" target="_blank"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.seti.org/drakeequation" target="_blank"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</body>

    <title>How Far Away Are the Aliens?</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;OK, let's make our jargon simpler. &amp;nbsp;Drake's equation refers to the number of life forms on habitable planets in the Galaxy that are intelligent in the sense that they have radio telescopes. &amp;nbsp;Most of us&amp;nbsp;have seen `science fiction' movies or read novels about such life forms ... and let's call them &lt;strong&gt;aliens&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;just to use simpler teminology.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can use our estimate of the Drake Equation to ask the question: &lt;strong&gt;What is the average distance between civilizations in the Galaxy?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider that most stars lie in the Galactic disk (the Galactic halo has fewer stars and these have lower metallicities, so plausibly fewer planets).&amp;nbsp; The Milky Way disk is roughly a cylinder with radius R and height h (in light years):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;2 pi R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; x h ~ 2 pi (100,000 ly)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; 1,500 ly ~&amp;nbsp; 1 x 10&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt; cubic light years&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the density of alien civilizations is their number divided by this volume:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;p&gt;Density of civilizations is = N&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; / (1 X 10&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;) civilizations per cubic light year&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If they are randomly distributed throughout the Galactic disk (not necessarily true!), then the&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;p&gt;Average distance between civilizations d = 1 / (Density)&lt;sup&gt;1/3&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;= (1x10&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;/N&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;1/3&lt;/sup&gt; light years&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;So, if N&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;=100, the average distance between civilizations d ~ (1x10&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;/100)&lt;sup&gt;1/3&lt;/sup&gt; = 10,000 ly.&amp;nbsp; For N&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;=10,000, d ~ 2,000 ly.&amp;nbsp; For N&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;=1,000,000, d ~ 500 ly.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The distance in light years is the time it takes to send a message in years. Twice this number is the time to send a message and get a reply.&amp;nbsp; So, meaningful conversations can take place on the timescales of human societies (say, a human lifetime around 100 years) only if one takes extremely optimistic numbers in the Drake Equation resulting in many millions of civilizations.&amp;nbsp; For less optimistic values, it is possible that civilizations can never meaningfully communicate (i.e. back-and-forth conversation) because the time to send/receive a message is longer than the duration of a civilization. Of course, if N&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;=1, we are the only communicable civilization, and there is no one else to talk to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would like to point out the nature of our argument here. This is not a philosophical, or subjective, discussion. It is quantitative. We are using arithmetic (Drake's equation), geometry (cylinder shape), and algebra (density estimation) to evaluate a quantity of interest (How far away are they?) for a reasonable range of values representing our empirical knowledge and uncertainty. This is an example of scientific inference -- the scientific method -- at work, even though the result is still uncertain.&lt;/p&gt;</body>

    <title>Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligences (SETI)</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;If N&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;(minus one, ourselves) intelligences exist in the Galaxy at a typical distance of hundreds (optimistic N&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;) to tens-of-thousands (pessimistic N&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;) light years distance, how do we best communicate with them? &amp;nbsp;On Earth, advanced organisms communicate by sound waves that travel through air or water. &amp;nbsp;But in interstellar space, such waves are difficult to produce and travel slowly. &amp;nbsp;It is best to use light waves that travel at c=300,000 kilometers/second. &amp;nbsp;Physics tells us that nothing can travel faster than light! &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What waveband should we use?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us recall the types of light we can produce and detect, the electromagnetic spectrum:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/_legacy/astro140/spectrum.jpg" style="width: 500px; height: 263px; "&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sixty years ago, scientists like Frank Drake, Phil Morrison, and Josef Schlovsky asked: &amp;nbsp;Which wavebands of light are best for communicating across our Galactic disk?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hard X-rays/gamma-rays&lt;/b&gt;: Hard to produce, impossible to focus&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ultraviolet/soft X-rays&lt;/b&gt;: Absorbed by atoms in interstellar gas (and Earth's atmosphere)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Optical&lt;/b&gt;: Signals overwhelmed by starlight (unless pulsed rapidly)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Infrared&lt;/b&gt;: Overwhelmed by interstellar &amp; interplanetary dust emission (and Earth's atmosphere)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Microwave&lt;/b&gt;: Overwhelmed by the cosmic microwave background radiation from the Big Bang that formed the Universe&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Centimeter-wavelength (1-30 GHz) radio&lt;/b&gt;: YES! No problem!!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Longer than meter wavelength&lt;/b&gt;: Overwhelmed by interstellar electron synchrotron emission&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Non-electromagnetic radiation&lt;/b&gt;: neutrino beams? neutron beams? other subatomic particles? Technologies ineffective or not available to us yet.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it seems that radio wavelengths are best for interstellar communication. &amp;nbsp;Large radio telescopes sensitive to centimeter wavelength light are easily constructed (e.g. Arecibo Telescope in Puerto Rico, Very Large Array in New Mexico - photos below), radio waves are easily focused (paraboloid shaped dishes), radio receivers are extremely sensitive for reception, and radio broadcasting is easy (e.g. TV stations, radar at airports). Existing radio telescopes could easily detect a typical terrestrial radio/TV broadcast across the Galaxy -- if it were beamed directly towards us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/_legacy/astro140/arecibo1.jpg" style="width: 400px; height: 327px; "&gt; &amp;nbsp;&lt;img alt="" src="/_legacy/astro140/vla.jpg" style="width: 600px; height: 312px; "&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What frequency should we use?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Examples: AM band from 0.5-1.6 MHz; FM from 88-108 MHz; TV scattered from 50-1000 MHz, plus police/taxi radios, airport/military radar, satellite communications, etc. Only a few narrow bands are kept quiet for radio astronomy. &amp;nbsp;Arguments have been made that the best frequency to use is around 1420 MHz (21.1 cm), the emission line of cold hydrogen. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;But the best answer is: "We can not know what frequencies the alien civilizations will use to listen or broadcast their signals". &amp;nbsp;So we build&amp;nbsp;build receivers that analyze signals from many (million, billion!) channels simultaneously within broad radio astronomical bands.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;How do we recognize an alien signal?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Criteria might include: narrow band signal at wavelength not produced by atoms &amp; molecules; rapid variations in signal intensity (a message!) but not a radio pulsar; signal seen from star with good lifezone for habitable planets: signal seen in different telescopes (not local interference); periodic intensity or Doppler shifts from from their planet's rotation/orbit; signal contains complex information.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Could Earth be detected by other civilizations?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Major emission in centimeter band are military radar (esp. over Alaska and Siberia) and TV stations (esp. over US and Europe). See our text's Figure 9.6 for the daily variation expected in some radio band as the Earth rotates and various radio transmitters rise and set. The Arecibo Telescope could detect these signals out to a few parsecs (tens of stars. Even with our current technology, we could increase sensitivity 100-fold to detect such signals from many thousands of stars. (For example, we could build a large antenna inside a crater on the Moon.) TV broadcasts from 1978 had ~10 million watts power, and are now 20 lightyears (6 pc) away with ~20 A-G-K main sequence stars and hundreds of lower-mass M stars. Now that we know that most stars have planetary systems, and perhaps 1-10% have nearly Earth-size planets in Habitable Zones, it is not impossible that an advanced civilization has already picked up our early radio, television, and radar signals. Indeed, this is the plot of the movie Contact based on the early career of Dr. Jill Tarter, Director of the SETI institute in California. (She is still active, and was a member of the Kepler Science Team.) So the answer to this question is a clear Yes !&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;A large SETI project: Project Phoenix&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div&gt;About 1000 solar-like stars within 50 pc have been targeted with Parkes (Australia) 210-foot, Green Bank (West Virginia) 140-foot, and Arecibo (Puerto Rico) 1000-meter telescopes during the 1990s. ~50 million channels at 1-2 Hz resolution between 1-3 GHz (30-10 cm wavelength) are examined for continuous and pulsed signals, including frequency drifts. &amp;nbsp;Stars with newly discovered planets were included in search. They used private funding because Federal funding was shut off in 1993 by Congress. &amp;nbsp;They would have required confirmation by an independent observatory required for identifying a candidate extreterrestrial signal. &amp;nbsp;The main technical challenge they faced was: elimination of human radio interference. &amp;nbsp;The image below shows frequency (horizontal axis) vs. time (vertical axis) brightness plot with an example of interference.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/_legacy/astro140/phoenix-4.gif" style="width: 460px; height: 346px; "&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Excerpt from the &lt;a href="http://www.seti-inst.edu/science/phoenix2002.html" target="_blank"&gt;Project Phoenix diaries&lt;/a&gt;, March 21 2002 at Arecibo (by Seth Shostak, SETI Institute):&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jane Jordan and I tried not to get too excited. A signal picked up while observing target 4505, a star very slightly dimmer than the Sun that's 117 light-years away, was persistent and passing all the usual tests. We moved the telescope off the star system, and the signal went away. We ran it back on the target, and the signal reappeared. It was looking good. We continued to examine 4505 until the Earth?s rotation took it beyond Arecibo?s field of view, and it looked good all the while. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nonetheless, we've developed a certain &amp;nbsp;resistance to easy adrenaline rushes. &amp;nbsp;The microwave band is increasingly &amp;nbsp;jammed by interference from orbiting &amp;nbsp;satellites, so false alarms are common. &amp;nbsp;As target 4505 drifted out of sight to the west, I wrote in the log book "should be &amp;nbsp;re-observed." The next night, we did exactly that. This time the signal was seen not only in the direction of the star, &amp;nbsp;but in other directions as well. Sadly, it was just more earthly interference, and definitely not extraterrestrial.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;em&gt;One of these days, this small scenario may end differently. And occasionally we think about that. &amp;nbsp;It's after midnight. Jill Tarter has taken over the observing, so I walk outside the control room to the patio that overlooks the telescope. Overhead, the familiar &amp;nbsp;winter constellations prick the humid air. Is there more out there than simply the &amp;nbsp;frigid blackness of space and the silent boiling of the stars? Are there hidden places where the sounds of life are being made and heard? Do beings exist that &amp;nbsp;can see the universe and understand what they see? It seems impossible to imagine otherwise.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Allen Telescope Array&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Initially funded by Paul Allen, founder of Microsoft Corp with Bill Gates, the &lt;a href="http://www.seti.org/ata" target="_blank"&gt;Allen Telescope Array&lt;/a&gt; of small antennas has been constructed in northern California for full-time SETI search. &amp;nbsp;This increased SETI observations considerably over earlier levels, but the project is suffering from lack of funds. &amp;nbsp;Initially planned to comprise 350 6-member dishes, only 42 have been built. &amp;nbsp; The ATA has four primary advantages for scientific studies over other major radio telescopes: a very wide field-of-view (2.45° at λ = 21cm), complete instantaneous frequency coverage from 0.5 to 11.2 GHz, multiple simultaneous electronic backends, and active interference mitigation. The instantaneous area of sky imaged is 17 times that of the VLA. The instantaneous frequency coverage of more than 4 octaves is unprecedented in radio astronomy.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/_legacy/astro140/800px-ata42-construction.jpg" style="width: 400px; height: 300px; "&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;img alt="" src="/_legacy/astro140/ATA-pix15.jpg" style="width: 470px; height: 300px; "&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Despite funding problems, the ATA has been operating for several years and is mostly devoted to SETI searches. &amp;nbsp;It both make shallow scans of large portions of the sky and deeper observations targetted at selected stars. &amp;nbsp;These include stars near the Sun and stars with known exoplanets (e.g. in the Kepler field). &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;The results from all SETI programs over 50 years are clear: &amp;nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;b&gt;No extraterrestrial signals have been detected !! &amp;nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Not a single convincing alien signal has emerged from ANY SETI observation to date&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Nonetheless, the search continues and, some would&amp;nbsp;argue that it should be expanded. &amp;nbsp;Jill Tarter gives the following analogy: We have only sampled the stars in the Galaxy to the level of a teaspoon of sea water has sampled the world's oceans. &amp;nbsp;If you don't see a fish in the teaspoon, can you infer that fish don't exist in the ocean? &amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</body>

    <title>Interstellar Travel: Very hard but not impossible</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This lecture uses some physics and math (algebra level). &amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;While you do not have to reproduce these calculations, &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;you should be able to understand the logical flow and the basic results.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recall after our Drake equation discussion that the distance to the body-of-interest in the Galaxy is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;p&gt;d = (2x10&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;/N)&lt;sup&gt;1/3&lt;/sup&gt; parsecs,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;where N is the number of bodies-of-interest. &amp;nbsp;If&amp;nbsp;we were interested in advanced communicable civilizations, and we had chosen inputs to&amp;nbsp;the Drake Equation that resulted in an&amp;nbsp;estimate of N~10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;, then N is a relative small number by astronomical standards. &amp;nbsp;But if we are interested in visiting any nearby habitable planet, N~10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;, a much bigger number.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's assume here an intermediate value of N~10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;. &amp;nbsp;Then the equation above tells us that the nearest habitable planet is at a distance of d = 30 parsecs ~ 100 lightyears ~ 1x10&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;meters.&amp;nbsp; Our current spacecraft (e.g. Space Shuttle, planetary probes) travel at a speed around v = 10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; m/s, so the travel time would be&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;p&gt;t = d/v = 1x10&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;m / 10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; m/s = 1x10&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;sec ~ 3 million years.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This roughly the age of hominids ... human-like primates roved the savannahs of Africa 3 million years ago. &amp;nbsp;This is far too long for a convenient visit to a new planet!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The obvious solution is to develop rocket propulsions that give faster speeds, say v = 0.1 c = 3x10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; m/s.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Now the travel time would be&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;p&gt;t = 1x10&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;m / 3x10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; m/s = 3x10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;s = 1 thousand years,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;which is still very long but not inconceivable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's check whether the human body can tolerate the acceleration and deceleration up to these speeds.&amp;nbsp; A spacecraft acceleration equivalent to the gravitational acceleration we feel on Earth's surface would be a ~ v/t ~ 10 m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&amp;nbsp; To reach a speed of v=0.1c would take&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;p&gt;t ~ v / a = 3x10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; m/s / 10 m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 1 month,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;which is no problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now let's check the power requirements.&amp;nbsp; Assume the spacecraft has a mass of 100 tons, equivalent to a dozen trucks.&amp;nbsp; Its kinetic energy is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;p&gt;E = 1/2 m v&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 1/2 (1x10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; kg) (3x10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; m/s)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 5x10&lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt; watt-sec.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The engine power must thus be at least&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;p&gt;E / t = 5x10&lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt; watt-s / 3x10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;s ~ 2000 megawatts,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;comparable to a big modern power station that generates electricity for a major city.&amp;nbsp; (Here I've assumed acceleration throughout the thousand-year trip.) This doesn't seem too difficult ... we obviously know how to build a power station. But how do we fit the power station into a small spacecraft and, more importantly, how do we fit all of its fuel supply into this small volume. Coal, petroleum, even uranium to power the plant for a thousand years cannot fit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only choice is to use the most efficient source of energy known, one that directly taps Einstein's equivalence of mass and energy, E=mc&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&amp;nbsp; For such a fuel, we only need a small mass:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;p&gt;m = E / c&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; ~ 5x10&lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt; watt-s / (3x10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; m/s)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 500 kg,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;which is within the mass budget for our interstellar spaceship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we can, in principle, build and power an interstellar space ship that will take (only!) a thousand years to reach the nearest habitable planet. &amp;nbsp;But the only efficient way we know to derive this energy is from the annihilation of matter and anti-matter, and we have not been able to make and transport more than infinitisimal quantities of anti-matter. The giant particle accelerator at Fermilab's Main Injector (underground near Chicago) can accumulate ~10&lt;sup&gt;-8&lt;/sup&gt; grams of antiprotons/year. If Fermilab uses ~10&lt;sup&gt;-4&lt;/sup&gt; of modern society's energy resources, it would take 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; years to collect the fuel our spaceship. This is reduced to ~10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; years if one could tap all of the solar energy incident on the Earth's surface, and less if one could build a Ringworld or a Dyson sphere to trap a greater fraction of their Sun's energy output. The antiprotons produced must then be cooled with electrons in magnetic traps and (perhaps) stored as solid antihydrogen until needed for flight propulsion. See the analysis &lt;a href="http://www.engr.psu.edu/antimatter/Papers/anti_prod.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Production and trapping of antimatter for space propulsion applications&lt;/a&gt; by (former-PSU Physics professor) G. A. Smith &amp; colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We thus find that it is totally impractical to fuel an interstellar spaceship, even though it is not physically impossible to build it. &amp;nbsp;Arguments have been made to mitigate this problem; for instance, build a `ramjet' that collects protons (or even some antiprotons) from the interstellar medium as the space ship travels forward. &amp;nbsp;But designs have always encountered enormous practical barriers. &amp;nbsp;Another possibility is to build a "sail" that is propelled by reflecting light. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, in 2016&amp;nbsp;a team announced a &lt;a href="https://breakthroughinitiatives.org/Initiative/3" target="_blank"&gt;new interstellar&amp;nbsp;travel project&lt;/a&gt; within the goal of sending tiny probes ("gram scale")&amp;nbsp;to Alpha Centauri using a lightsail and arrays of antennas transmitting gigawatt-hours of energy to accelerate them to roughly a 1/6 the speed light. &amp;nbsp;The project leaders&amp;nbsp;deem this to&amp;nbsp;feasible with realistic technological improvements within a few decades. The initial effort is funded by a Silicon Valley billionaire, and advisory council includes distinguished astrophysicists. See the New York Times article &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/13/science/alpha-centauri-breakthrough-starshot-yuri-milner-stephen-hawking.html" target="_blank"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;b&gt;Conclusion: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;big&gt;The distances between existing intelligent civilizations is likely to be &gt;1000 light years, but the distances to neraby habitable planets may only be ~100 lightyears. &amp;nbsp;It is physically possible for a civilization&amp;nbsp; to travel such distances if the travel time is long (say 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; yrs).&amp;nbsp; Is very difficult, but it is not physically impossible. &lt;/big&gt;While we cannot build a functioning interstellar space ship today, we know that, at lesat in principle, it is not impossible. Perhaps a more advance civilization, or perhaps in ourselves in the far future, can build one. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we were to focus&amp;nbsp;on very small probes and the very closest stars, then&amp;nbsp;it's not inconceivable that humans could send very small satellites to some of the nearest stars within our life times. &amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</body>

    <title>Colonizing the Galaxy</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;Einstein's Special Relativity requires that travel by massive objects occur at sub-light speeds, and light-based communication travels at the speed of light. If habitable planets are relatively common (as recent astronomical discoveries suggest), typical distances between them may be (say) tens of light years. It will thus take decades to send/receive a message, and many/many years to travel between these planets. This would resemble the 17th century when it took weeks for a ship to travel between Europe and the Americas -- but much slower. Meaningful interchange between the home planet and colonies will be ineffective, and colonies will be largely independent. A tightly knit Galactic Empire is thus very unlikely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Colonizing the Galaxy, however, could occur surprisingly rapidly if interstellar space travel were achieved. Imagine that we or another intelligent species did acquire the technology (and desire) to colonize neighboring habitable planets. Let us guess:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The PMXZVQ civilization travels at v=0.1c so it takes 500 years to reach a habitable planet 50 lightyears away.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;They take 4000 years for the colony to get settled, establish farms and factories, communicate with home base 50 times, and build new spaceships.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;They proceed onto new habitable planets, reaching the nearest in 500 years.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The civilization would thus radiate outward from its original planet at roughly 50 LY/5000 yrs or 50,000 LY in 50 million years. The entire Galaxy could thus be colonized in 10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;yrs. This is only 1/500th the age of the Sun and 0.0001 times the age of the Galaxy -- an extremely brief moment!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some scholars (e.g. Enrico Fermi, Frank Tipler) use this calculation to conclude that no spacefaring civilization has yet existed in the Galaxy. If it had, Earth would have rapidly been colonized at least once, perhaps many times. Yet we have no clear evidence of ancient or present alien civilizations, and we find no non-DNA-based lifeforms. Maybe we are alone in the Galaxy? Perhaps the development of intelligent life is very rare, or even life itself is rare? This line of reasoning is nicknamed the &lt;b&gt; Fermi paradox &lt;/b&gt; (thought it isn't really a paradox, just a logical argument). It is discussed briefly in Chpt 9.5 of our textbook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A great deal has been said about the Fermi paradox -- `Where are the aliens?' --&amp;nbsp;mostly empty speculation. &amp;nbsp;But I can recommend a few contributions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/13.7/2017/11/14/564046268/on-the-alien-question-where-are-they" target="_blank"&gt;Marcelo Gleiser&lt;/a&gt; from Dartmouth College has outlines a few possible explanations&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A&lt;a href="http://fermisparadox.com/Possible-answers-to-fermi-paradox.htm" target="_blank"&gt; Fermi's Paradox&lt;/a&gt; Web site outlines various possibilities&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.seti.org/seti-institute/project/details/fermi-paradox" target="_blank"&gt;SETI Institute&lt;/a&gt; thinks we are alone&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.space.com/38577-fermi-paradox-alien-life-buried-oceans.html" target="_blank"&gt;Alan Stern&lt;/a&gt;, a prominent space scientist, suggests the aliens&amp;nbsp;are under ice&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://nickbostrom.com/extraterrestrial.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Nick Bostrom&lt;/a&gt; of Oxford University described a Great Filter&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-talk/computing/hardware/computing-and-the-fermi-paradox-a-new-idea-emergestheyre-all-asleep" target="_blank"&gt;David Schneider&lt;/a&gt; of IEEE Spectrum (an engineering journal) gives possibilities relating to computers&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A Web site self-styled `We come from the future' gives `&lt;a href="https://io9.gizmodo.com/11-of-the-weirdest-solutions-to-the-fermi-paradox-456850746" target="_blank"&gt;11 of the Weirdest&lt;/a&gt;' solutions to the Fermi Paradox&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;b&gt;Conclusion: Travel between "uninhabited but habitable" planets may be significantly easier that travel between the rare intelligent civilizations, as the discovery of many extrasolar planets indicates planetary systems around solar-type stars are common.&amp;nbsp; The distances to travel may be ~10 lightyears to ~1000 lightyears.&amp;nbsp; It is conceivable a civilization could achieve this: one-way invasion/colonization of the Milky Way Galaxy is not impossible.&amp;nbsp; However, the planets will be largely decoupled from each other, and a meaningful Galactic civilization (government, trade, culture, etc) seems unachievable.&lt;/b&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>UFOs:  Have aliens visited us?</title>
    <body>&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;Can people distinguish between science and pseudo-science?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A poll of 1000 adult Americans by the Center for Survey and Research Analysis in 2005 shows that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;60% believe extraterrestrial life exists on other planets.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;37% believe that houses can be haunted&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;25% believe people can hear from, or communicate mentally, with the dead&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;25% think that astrology can affect people&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;51% said no to the statement: "Do you believe that extraterrestrial beings have visited Earth at some time in the past" &amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;(This view in decreasing in popularity: 41% said No in a 1990 poll, and 38% said No in a 2001poll)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The International Center for the Study of Scientific Literacy &lt;a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/1996/05/24/MN67867.DTL" target="_blank"&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; that 20% of Americans are not sure whether the Sun revolves around the Earth or the other way ‘round.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One should be careful in interpreting survey results. &amp;nbsp;For example, a non-random Internet survey from a radio show "The X Zone" with 19,000 respondents found 77% believe in ghosts and 93% do not believe astronauts really walked on the Moon.&amp;nbsp; See Seth Shoshak &lt;a href="http://www.space.com/searchforlife/seti_shostak_believe_051103.html" target="_blank"&gt;discussion&lt;/a&gt; for details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/_legacy/astro140/photo8.jpg" style="width: 760px; height: 250px; "&gt;&lt;br&gt;See&amp;nbsp; &lt;a href="http://ufoevidence.org" target="_blank"&gt;http://ufoevidence.org&lt;/a&gt; for more examples&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One can argue that UFOs definitely exist: anything in the air that is not immediately explained is unidentified. Upon investigation, 90% of reports to the &lt;a href="http://www.cufos.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Center for UFO Studies&lt;/a&gt; end up identified (nocturnal advertising aircraft, Venus or other planets, weather balloons, atmospheric refraction, hoaxes, pranks, etc). Similarly, only a few of the 1000 incidents reported to the 1960s panel headed by astronomer J. Allen Hynek were difficult to explain. These often depended on the testimony of unreliable witnesses (e.g. who make other unsubstantiated and unlikely claims). Lawyers and judges know that eyewitness accounts are often very inaccurate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is quite suspicious that the number of UFO sightings are highly variable (e.g. 1966 had 3 times as many reports as 1963, 1952 was 8 times higher than 1951) but the fraction that remain unexplained always remains ~1%, according to the US Air Force Project Bluebook. How could the many people reporting false sightings know that the small number of true UFO sightings has increased or decreased? A more reasonable explanation is that none of the sightings are due to aliens, are 1% are simply completely false or too complicated to easily understand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One complication is the assertion that the U.S. government has knowledge of UFOs and suppresses it. &amp;nbsp;Indeed, it's not uncommon for&amp;nbsp;governments or people with political power to try to keep secrets. &amp;nbsp;However, it's also quite common that such secrets eventually become public. &amp;nbsp;For example,&amp;nbsp;the Roswell Incident (strange stuff falling from the sky in New Mexico in 1947, early reports of recovery of a large disk) may have a factual basis in secret Air Force research involving aviation and balloon technology which has only recently been declassified. However, there is no evidence that the government is withholding any evidence that UFOs are of extraterrestrial origin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another complication is that hoaxes, pranks and frauds are also common among UFO sightings and similar claims for alien presence. &amp;nbsp;The most famous case (not flying objects) are the British crop circles. &amp;nbsp;These strange geometric patterns appeared overnight randomly in English wheat and or other crop fields for ~30 years. &amp;nbsp;Then, in 1991, two men admitted to creating the circles as a hoax since 1978, and they demonstrated their method for journalists (see instructions&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Make-a-Crop-Circle" style="color: rgb(2, 122, 198); text-decoration: none; " target="_blank"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). &amp;nbsp;Thousands of copy-cat patterns appeared worldwide. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; See a good presentation of the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crop_circle" style="color: rgb(2, 122, 198); text-decoration: none; " target="_blank"&gt;crop circle story on Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;nbsp;Nonetheless, many fans believe they arise from magical or extraterrestrial causes (e.g. see the million-view YouTube video&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ql1PPkZiHl8" style="color: rgb(2, 122, 198); text-decoration: none; " target="_blank"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recall also that millions of people suffer from schizophrenia and similar serious mental diseases that involve hallucinations. &amp;nbsp;They often cannot distinguish their internal experience of imaginary phenomena from real experiences of physical phenomena. &amp;nbsp;Subjective reports can thus be wrong due to honest error, purposeful fraud, or medical disease.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some further thoughts from the Center for UFO Studies:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 90%-95% of all UFO reports prove to be IFOs [Identified Flying Objects], after an examination of the evidence by a trained investigator. People report natural or conventional objects as UFOs because they do not recognize them as such, due to unusual environmental conditions, ignorance, or the rarity of a natural event. For example, people have reported the planet Venus as a UFO ... or stars near the horizon. ... Generally, sightings occur in rural areas, small towns, and near military installations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Returning to Unidentified Flying Objects, there are few unquestionably authentic pictures of UFOs. Many so-called UFO photographs are really natural phenomena (such as strangely shaped clouds) or are light leaks in the camera or flaws that were introduced when the film was developed. Some photos are deliberate hoaxes made by people who want you to believe they have seen UFOs; for any number of reasons, such as fame, money, or to promote a religious or philosophical viewpoint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, the most significant Radar-Visual cases have come from Belgium where triangular-shaped UFOs were seen by military personnel and civilians and detected on military radar. The Belgian Air Force has publicly aired recordings of radar trackings that show objects making fantastic maneuvers at incredibly high speeds that are far beyond the capabilities of conventional aircraft. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is increasing discussion of the possibilities that some UFO sightings are new technology military aircraft.&amp;nbsp; Here are photos of a few publicly known advanced aircraft from the U.S. military: AGM-129 cruise missile, Boeing X-15A Waverider, Honeywell RQ-16 T-Hawk, McDonnell Douglas A-12 Avenger II (cancelled), and a MZ-3A blimp. The images are from Wikipedia. &amp;nbsp;These aircraft definitely look odd, and might be mistaken for a UFO. &amp;nbsp;And there are probably more advanced aircraft being tested that are not yet announced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/_legacy/astro140/800px-Agm-129_acm.jpg" style="width: 524px; height: 300px; "&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;img alt="" src="/_legacy/astro140/714px-X-51A_Waverider.jpg" style="width: 357px; height: 300px; "&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;img alt="" src="/_legacy/astro140/416px-Class1Soldiers2.jpg" style="width: 208px; height: 300px; "&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;img alt="" src="/_legacy/astro140/A-12_Avenger_in_flight_NAN11-90.jpg" style="width: 427px; height: 250px; "&gt; &amp;nbsp;&lt;img alt="" src="/_legacy/astro140/800px-thumbnail.jpg" style="width: 381px; height: 250px; "&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ufoseek.com/Alternative_Explanations/Secret_Military_Aircraft/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.ufoseek.com/Alternative_Explanations/Secret_Military_Aircraft/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the lack of success in discovering extraterrestrial signals, all astronomers consider the evidence for many habitable worlds to be very convincing, and thus the possibility of extraterrestrial life (though difficult to quantify) is not necessarily low. Yet nearly all astronomers discount the argument that Unidentified Flying Objects are good evidence for spaceships from extraterrestrial intelligences. &amp;nbsp;Why such skepticism? &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main problem is that the evidence for the UFO-alien connection is always so fragmentary. Why are UFO photographs usually blurred or indistinct, or easily altered using Photoshop? Why is there no physical evidence anywhere (even claimed by UFO enthusiasts) for alien materials or technologies? Even a small technological object that could not be manufactured on Earth, or a smudge of complex organic material that is not based on DNA/protein/etc chemistry, could be convincing if it were examined in multiple laboratories around the world. &amp;nbsp;Instead, we have endless subjective reports or unconvincing non-physical evidence. &amp;nbsp; In this respect, UFOs resemble claims for parapsychology and ESP, sightings of Bigfoot, the Loch Ness monster, ghosts or (in past centuries) fairies and Leprechauns. We all like stories about imaginary creatures ... but adults generally don't believe they are real. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;b&gt;In summary, there is no credible or scientifically accepted evidence that alien life forms have visited Earth in recent times. However, `absence of evidence does not imply evidence of absence'; it is impossible to disprove the hypothesis that aliens visit Earth if the visits can leave no tangible evidence. In this sense, the alien UFO hypothesis is not a scientific theory -- it is not falsifiable. However, it is verifiable if any physical material (manufactured or biological) inconsistent with a terrestrial origin were produced associated with a UFO report.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What might realistic alien visitors be like?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the Drake Equation and our discussion of interstellar spaceflight, we infer that it is possible that the Galaxy has spacefaring civilizations Let's think about what a scientifically plausible alien visit might be like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Very large and massive spaceship capable of v &gt; 0.1 c (c = speed of light) travel and conditions to keep organisms alive for (say) 10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; years. Fictional examples from Hollywood of really huge alien space ships include the mother ship in &lt;i&gt;Independence Day &lt;/i&gt;and the underwater ship in &lt;i&gt;The Abyss&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Spaceship must have more advanced technology than ours, but still obeying physical laws. No Warp Drives or other faster-than-light travel. Probably powered by nuclear fusion, black hole accretion or similar highly efficient energy source based on E=mc&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Ship likely to be heavily shielded against rocket emissions, cosmic rays and interstellar debris. Streamlined shapes are unnecessary.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Alien morphology unlike any on Earth. Not humanoid with two arms, two legs and head (e.g. in the movies &lt;i&gt;E.T., Close Encounters of the Third Kind, StarTrek,&lt;/i&gt; etc). Not resembling insects, spiders, lobsters or octopi (e.g. H.G. Wells' &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;War of the Worlds&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Starship Troopers, Men in Black&lt;/i&gt;). They could have any shape and (nearly) any size.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Alien visitors are unlikely to be elusive. They are on a one-way trip. If we were the alien visitors to another planet, it is almost certain that we would need to&amp;nbsp;use resources from the new planet in order to continue to survive. &amp;nbsp;If the planet already had other lifeforms on it (even microscopic), then there could be serious consequences for one or both civilizations. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</body>

    <body>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Universe formed in a Big Bang&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; 13.7 billion years ago with early conditions leading to protons, neutrons and electrons .... lots of Dark Matter, hydrogen and helium in an expanding space-time.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Gravity pulls the matter inwards locally, &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;producing galaxies, stars over billions of years&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. &amp;nbsp;The stars fuse H and He to heavier elements like carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, silicon and iron. &amp;nbsp;The stars eject some of this processed material back into the galaxies, so that &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;new generations of stars can form with chemically enriched protoplanetary disks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Astronomers see these protoplanetary disks around all stars forming in nearby molecular clouds today. &amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The disks have the basic molecules of planets and life&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;: silicates and soot for the rocky bodies, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;+H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O+NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;... for the atmospheres.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Astronomers have now detected the resulting planetary systems around thousands of stars using sensitive techniques such as Doppler radial velocities, planetary transits, and microlensing. &amp;nbsp;We infer that &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;virtually all stars have planets&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, and that &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;many are Earth-like planets in Habitable Zones&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; where surface water can be liquid.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Robotic probes to Mars, asteroids and the outer Jovial systems reveal that liquids are (or were) present&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; in various locations in our Solar System. &amp;nbsp;Mars once has flowing rivers and seas of water, Europa and other Jovian moons have liquid water oceans under the surface ice, and Titan has a unique ecology of methane+ethane streams and lakes. &amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No living organisms have been found outside Earth&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, but these environments conceivably could be inhabited by extremophile-like micro-organisms.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The evolution of life on Earth is now well-understood&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;: the processes studied by Charles Darwin have been spectacularly confirmed by studies of DNA genetic sequences. &amp;nbsp;All lifeforms share a common heritage with similar biochemistry, cell biology and genetics. &amp;nbsp;Archaea (often extremophile) bacteria are the most ancient organisms. &amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But the original formation of a self-reproducing cell from inorganic components on the early Earth is still not understood&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;With billions of habitable planets in the Galaxy now inferred from exoplanet studies, the possibilities of extraterrestrial life rests on a stronger scientific foundation than in the past. &amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;However, there is no convincing evidence of extraterrestrial life from any type of study&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;: &amp;nbsp;astronomical observations (SETI), robotic probes (Solar System), terrestrial studies (UFOs, etc). &amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We do not know whether we are the only technologically developed life form in the Galaxy, or whether &amp;nbsp;there are many other advanced alien civilizations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. &amp;nbsp;Either possibility is reasonable. &amp;nbsp;Interstellar communication between civilizations (ours or others) on proximate habitable planets is not difficult. &amp;nbsp;Interstellar travel between habitable planets is extremely difficult, but not physically impossible.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-left: 40px; "&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;In conclusion, life exists in the Universe ... on Earth. &amp;nbsp;The conditions for life arising elsewhere are widespread: there are lots of similar planets with similar surface conditions and similar chemistry. &amp;nbsp;But we do not know if extraterrestrial life is indeed present, or whether it has evolved to be technologically advanced on any planet except Earth.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</body>

    <title>The Anthropic Principle: A Modern Philosophical View</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;For several decades, some astrophysicists have discussed arguments that the observed conditions of the physical Universe are closely linked in some way to the existence of living organisms such as ourselves. The sizes, masses and ages of objects we see (atoms, living organisms, planets, stars, galaxies, Universe) can all be related to a few basic physical constants: the relative strengths of gravitational, electrical, atomic and nuclear forces; the relative masses of protons and electrons; and parameters of cosmology. The existence of these objects thus places constraints on these elementary physical constants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The possibility of life as we know it evolving in the Universe depends on the values of a few basic physical constants—and is in some respects remarkably sensitive to their numerical values.'' (Carr &amp; Rees, 1979)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, the existence of life on silicate + water planets requires that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;the universal expansion following the Big Bang is tuned to produce long-lived gravitationally collapsed structures.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;the ratio of light to particles in the Universe is sufficiently low to permit particles to form neutral atoms and permit gravitational collapse of stars.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;the constants of nuclear physics are tuned to give long-lived main sequence phases of stars and red giants that synthesize heavy elements.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Together, such requirements place stringent constraints on the fundamental constants of nature, sometimes constraining them to with a few percent of their observed values. These arguments can be made in considerable detail. Here are some details:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;If the expansion after the Big Bang was weaker than we observe (with other cosmological conditions left the same), then the Universe would expand only briefly before recollapsing. Long-lived stars and planets would not have time to exist. If the Big Bang were stronger than it was, particles would be dispersed before gravity could collect them into galaxies and stars. This requires a delicate balance of ordinary matter,&amp;nbsp;Dark Matter and Dark Energy.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If the nuclear isotope of lithium &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;Li were stable, then the fusion of 4 &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H --&gt; &lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;He would proceed directly and quickly in the cores of stars, and the main sequence phase would not last billions of years. &amp;nbsp;Since it is not stable, main sequence stars fuse hydrogen to helium via&amp;nbsp;slower, circuitous pathways.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If the carbon nucleus &lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;C had an energy state just below -- instead of just above -- the energy of a beryllium &lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;Be energy state, then red giant nucleosynthesis would end at beryllium and heavier elements such as carbon or oxygen would be rare.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If Newton's law of gravity were F = GMm/r&lt;sup&gt;2.1&lt;/sup&gt; rather than GMm/r&lt;sup&gt;2.0&lt;/sup&gt;, then there would be no stable orbits of a planet around a star.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These arguments are collectively known as the Anthropic Principle. Several variations are discussed (weak Anthropic Principle, strong Anthropic Principle, final Anthropic Principle, etc). Many scientists dislike these arguments intensely: they seem post hoc, where observed phenomena somehow act backward in time on past conditions. How could the existence of humans 13 billion years after the formation of the Universe affect its properties?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the problems of reverse causation are partly resolved if one considers the possibility of many "Universes", each with different physical properties. Then, life would exist only in those with the necessary conditions; most universes would not have living organisms. The Many Universes Hypothesis (or multiverse) is now considered seriously by some scientists who like to venture into philosphy, e.g.&amp;nbsp;in the context of some theories of quantum relativity and inflationary cosmology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Please watch the 21-minute &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf7BXwVeyWw" target="_blank"&gt;TED talk by Brian Greene&lt;/a&gt; on the Anthropic Principle and the multiverse hypothesis. &amp;nbsp;Prof. Greene is a young physicist renown for his clear communication of complex concepts to the public. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the transition from inflation to ordinary expansion results occurs separately in different regions, each of which produces a "Universe" with its own "Big Bang" and unique physical&amp;nbsp;properties? Perhaps there `are' (in some sense of existence) many Universes within which only a very few have the carefully tuned conditions necessary for life. Of course, we must live in one of these rare Universes. &amp;nbsp;Unfortunately, most such ideas do not yield testable predictions. &amp;nbsp;Therefore, theories that are untestable are&amp;nbsp;beyond the realm of science and venture into other fields such&amp;nbsp;as philosophy or religion.&lt;/p&gt;</body>

    <title>Creationism and Intelligent Design</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;For 150 years, a debate has waged concerning the implications of&amp;nbsp;&lt;b&gt;Charles Darwin's&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;Origin of Species&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;(1859) for the Judeo-Christian belief that God created humankind as described in the&amp;nbsp;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Book of Genesis&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;.&amp;nbsp; William Paley (&lt;i&gt;Natural Theology&lt;/i&gt;, 1802) argued that order (e.g. complex organisms) cannot arise from disorder (e.g. simpler organisms) and that Creator is required.&amp;nbsp; But Darwin's mechanisms of natural selection, as elucidated and confirmed by modern biology (mutation, sexual recombination, genetic mixing, species radiation, etc.), contradicts this claim.&amp;nbsp; It describes in great detail the development of complex life from simpler life.&amp;nbsp; Biochemical DNA-based life provides a continuous disequilibrium which, when interacting with complex and changing ecosystems, leads to the emergence of more complex species and the elimination of unfitindividuals.&amp;nbsp; However, the biochemical evidence does not clearly explain the emergence of the&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;first&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;lifeform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Times; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "&gt;&lt;font color="#000000"&gt;The debate wages on in the public arena: a recent poll in the U.S. indicates only 44% agree that humans descended from earlier lifeforms, and a law suit was recently argued in a Pennsylvania Federal court whether or not a statement regarding Intelligent Design should be included in a public school scence class. &amp;nbsp;(The judge ruled against Intelligent Design and in favor of modern biology.) &amp;nbsp;Many important church councils have formally stated that evolution is not a threat to belief in God (e.g.&lt;i&gt;Humani Generis&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;issued by Pope Pius XII 1950).&amp;nbsp; Some Christian scholars, often labeled&amp;nbsp;&lt;b&gt;Creation Scientists&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;in the 1980s, argued for the&amp;nbsp;&lt;b&gt;Young Earth hypothesis&lt;/b&gt;&amp;nbsp;-- that the world was formed in six days in 4004 BC as literally told in the Bible.&amp;nbsp; However, the vast majority of scientists believe the Young Earth hypothesis blatantly disagrees with a wealth of scientific results from biology, geology&amp;nbsp; and astronomy.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Times; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;font color="#000000"&gt;Here are some thoughts from creationists:&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Times; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "&gt;&lt;font color="#000000"&gt;"We have the biblical concept of a six-day creation, we have the concept of evolution over thousands of millions of years, and we have a number of views intermediate between the two.&amp;nbsp; Which is true?&amp;nbsp; Science is the best system devised by man to give us information about nature.&amp;nbsp; However, the conclusions of science are not final.&amp;nbsp; Science repeatedly revises and even reverses its conclusions ... [especially when dealing with a past that] cannot be experimentally repeated.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; When it comes to answering the great questions of origins, meaning, and destiny, science has lost its credentials.&amp;nbsp; This happened over a century ago when science decided to exclude God from its explanatory menu.&amp;nbsp; ... The Bible, on the other hand, takes a more open approach, inviting us to consider nature as well as God ... As such it has a broader base for addressing the questions or origins... Its internal consistency challenges any suggestion that it is a collection of invented stories.&amp;nbsp; This is not a book that we can easily dismiss. "&amp;nbsp; Ariel A. Roth in&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;In Six Days: Why Fifty Scientists Choose to Believe in Creation&lt;/i&gt;2000&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Times; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#000000"&gt;"Take the existence of the Universe.&amp;nbsp; To call it the result of an 'accident' raises many questions - and answers none.&amp;nbsp; The same is true of the 'Big Bang' theory.&amp;nbsp; Where, for instance, did the raw materials come from?&amp;nbsp; Not even a 'big bang' can make something out of nothing!&amp;nbsp; The evolutionary idea is widespread, but just as weak; how can 'nothing' evolve into 'something', let alone earth's amazingly complex life forms?"&amp;nbsp; John Blanchard&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;Ultimate Questions 1987,&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;pamphlet from Evangelical Press handed out on the Penn State campus.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some Creationists point to complex biological structures like the human eye, arguing that such an amazing organ could never develop through random evolutionary processes, and requires instead divine creation. &amp;nbsp;But detailed study of the evolution of the eye, from bacteria to primates, shows a long sequence of evolutionary changes. &amp;nbsp;Indeed, the human eye is not the best for many purposes. &amp;nbsp;You can hear some of this argument on YouTube: a 5-minute excerpt from Neil Degrasse Tyson's&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Cosmos&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;television series &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SXHMm5I-68" target="_blank"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and a longer 45-minute presentation by several scientists &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnAAcr-26NA" target="_blank"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#000000"&gt;During the 1990s, a more moderate viewpoint known as&amp;nbsp;&lt;b&gt;Intelligent Design&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;was developed by scholars who are both well-schooled in science and in religion.&amp;nbsp; They generally accept major portions of Darwinian evolution and astronomy; e.g. that the Earth is billions of years old, that 99% of species are now extinct, that all species were not in the Garden of Eden, and that genetic variations (e.g. poodles vs. Labrador dogs) can arise from natural selection.&amp;nbsp; But they assert that whole species cannot be descended from one another, and that the origin of life cannot have arisen from inorganic chemicals.&amp;nbsp; They argue that life itself is `irreducibly complex' and requires an intelligent creator, and that nature is fundamentally subordinate to God.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Times; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "&gt;&lt;font color="#000000"&gt;"Can the first self-replicating cell have come into existence by many slight modifications, or was God's intervention necessary through concious design?"&amp;nbsp; Michael Bahe&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;Darwin's Black Box: The Biochemical Challenge to Evolution&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;1996&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Times; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#000000"&gt;"If nature is all there is, and matter has to do its own creating, then there is every reason to believe that the Darwinian model is the best model we will ever have of how the job might have been done"&amp;nbsp; Phillip Johnson,&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;The Wedge of Truth: Splitting the Foundations of Naturalism&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;2000&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#000000"&gt;Biologists argue that even the emergence of first life can plausibly be explained by natural causes and effects: while any one molecular structure is unlikely to transform itself into a specific other structure, real evolutionary change occurs in huge populations under diverse circumstances (Robert Pennock&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;Tower of Babel: The Evidence Against the New Creationism&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;1999).&amp;nbsp; For example, the rapid emergence of bacteria resistent to antibiotics does not require Intelligent Design.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Some scientists argue strongly against the intellectual merits of Intelligent Design; here is one who avows a rational ecological ethic:&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Times; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "&gt;&lt;font color="#000000"&gt;.".. the time has run out for telling ourselves that we are the darlings of a deity who placed nature here for our convenience.&amp;nbsp; We are the most resourceful, but also the most dangerous and disruptive, animals in this corner of the Universe.&amp;nbsp; A Darwinian understanding of how we got that way could be the first step toward a wider ethics commensurate with our real transgressions, not against God but against Earth itself and its myriad forms of life."&amp;nbsp; Frederick Crews in&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;New York Review of Books&lt;/i&gt;Sept/Oct 2001.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#000000"&gt;Some leaders argue that science and religion can coexist by confining their scope and avoiding the claim that a single framework explains all aspects of human existence.&amp;nbsp; Stephen Jay Gould, one of the foremost Darwinian scholars, said that science and religion are&amp;nbsp;&lt;b&gt;non-overlapping magisteria&lt;/b&gt;&amp;nbsp;equally valuable for investigations of nature and for the pursuit of spiritual values, respectively.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Times; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "&gt;&lt;font color="#000000"&gt;"Science studies how the heavens go, religion how to go to heaven."&amp;nbsp; Stephen Jay Gould&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;Rocks of Ages: Science and Religion in the Fullness of Life&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;1999&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Times; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#000000"&gt;Humans are "&lt;i&gt;both&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;the products of evolution and the apple of God's eye".&amp;nbsp; John Haught&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;God After Darwin:A Theology of Evolution&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;2000&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#000000"&gt;"Pius XII stressed this essential point: if the human body takes its origin from pre-existent living matter, the spiritual soul is immediately created by God"&amp;nbsp; Pope John Paul II in a letter to the Vatican Academy of Sciences 1997 (quoted by Crews above)&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The professional scientific community is unanimous in its rejection of blurring the distinction between a scientific and religious approach to understanding evolution.&amp;nbsp; Here is the 2005 statement of the American Astronomical Society:&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-left: 40px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Times; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "&gt;The American Astronomical Society supports teaching evolution in our nation’s K-12 science classes. Evolution is a valid scientific theory for the origin of species that has been repeatedly tested and verified through observation, formulation of testable statements to explain those observations, and controlled experiments or additional observations to find out whether these ideas are right or wrong. A scientific theory is not speculation or a guess -- scientific theories are unifying concepts that explain the physical universe.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-left: 40px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Times; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;"&gt;"Astronomical observations show that the Universe is many billions of years old (see the AAS publication,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.aas.org/education/ancientuniverse.html" target="_blank"&gt;An Ancient Universe&lt;/a&gt;), that nuclear reactions in stars have produced the chemical elements over time, and recent observations show that gravity has led to the formation of many planets in our Galaxy. The early history of the solar system is being explored by astronomical observation and by direct visits to solar system objects. Fossils, radiological measurements, and changes in DNA trace the growth of the tree of life on Earth. The theory of evolution, like the theories of gravity, plate tectonics, and Big Bang cosmology, explains, unifies, and predicts natural phenomena. Scientific theories provide a proven framework for improving our understanding of the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-left: 40px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Times; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "&gt;In recent years, advocates of “Intelligent Design,” have proposed teaching “Intelligent Design” as a valid alternative theory for the history of life. Although scientists have vigorous discussions on interpretations for some aspects of evolution, there is widespread agreement on the power of natural selection to shape the emergence of new species. Even if there were no such agreement, “Intelligent Design” fails to meet the basic definition of a scientific idea: its proponents do not present&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;testable&lt;/em&gt;hypotheses and do not provide evidence for their views that can be verified or duplicated by subsequent researchers&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-left: 40px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Times; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "&gt;Since “Intelligent Design” is not science, it does not belong in the science curriculum of the nation’s primary and secondary schools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-left: 40px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Times; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "&gt;The AAS supports the positions taken by the National Academy of Sciences, the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the National Science Teachers’ Association, the American Geophysical Union, the American Chemical Society, and the American Association of Physics Teachers on the teaching of evolution. The AAS also supports the National Science Education Standards: they emphasize the importance of scientific methods as well as articulating well-established scientific theories.&lt;/p&gt;</body>

    <title>How to Find Evidence of Non-Communicating Life on Exoplanets?</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here we will&amp;nbsp;listen to a ~20 minute talk by Prof. Eric B. Ford from Penn State's Dept. of Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics. &amp;nbsp;This is the video he presents at this point in the Astro 140 curriculum. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Eric is a prize-winning researcher in&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;i&gt;exoplanetary astronomy, and he has an thoughtful and deeply informed analysis of what we can ... and can not ... expect to discover about life on exoplanets. &amp;nbsp;I recommend that you first read our textbook's Chpt. 8 on 'How to find life on exoplanets', as it interweaves&amp;nbsp;nicely with Eric's&amp;nbsp;presentation.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tips for Succeeding in this Course</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;We want you to enjoy Astro 140 and to do well in it. We do not subscribe to a "weed out" or "pass the best—flunk the rest" philosophy. By the nature of its content, however, Astro 140 is a course that requires your serious academic commitment. You will not succeed by quickly "skimming" the web pages and book chapters.&amp;nbsp;Even "reading" web pages and textbook is not sufficient for most students. You will need to pause, think about what you read&amp;nbsp;and self-assess how well you understand the content. It's a sign of maturity when you can recognize what aspects of the reading will require more study, such as rereading the material more slowly, seeking out an explanations from alternative sources, or asking questions.&amp;nbsp;At Penn State, a&amp;nbsp;credit represents about&amp;nbsp;40&amp;nbsp;hours of work, so our&amp;nbsp;3-credit course will require about&amp;nbsp;120 hours of your time or&amp;nbsp;8&amp;nbsp;hours-per-week during the&amp;nbsp;15-week semester.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having no face-to-face classes in a World Campus class has some disadvantages: &amp;nbsp;the students never meet the instructor or each other. &amp;nbsp;But there are advantages.&amp;nbsp; Students need not reside or travel to the Penn State campus; they can live anywhere in the world.&amp;nbsp; Students do not have to attend class at specific times; all interactions are asynchronous.&amp;nbsp; This is very convenient for individuals with other important responsibilities.&amp;nbsp; But the independence provided by World Campus does mean that students must be disciplined in devoting time to the course continuously during the semester.&amp;nbsp; Duties include: studying course material (on-line lectures, linked on-line material, textbook reading), taking timed quizzes (which must be taken within specified Friday-to-Monday intervals), writing two research papers with specified deadlines, participating in interactive discussions and an on-line research activity. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on our collective experience with past students we offer the following suggestions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Complete all&amp;nbsp;web&amp;nbsp;and textbook reading assignments each week. You are encouraged also to click on other web links and readings; they have been&amp;nbsp;selected&amp;nbsp;to give&amp;nbsp;a richer background on the issues while avoiding overwhelming detail.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Professor Ford&amp;nbsp;is available to answer questions, whether you are working ot better understand the material or eager to learn more about some aspect of the course. &amp;nbsp;Email him at &lt;a href="mailto:eford@psu.edu?subject=ASTRO%20140%3A%20"&gt;eford@psu.edu&lt;/a&gt; with "ASTRO 140" in the subject line.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We&amp;nbsp;suggest you schedule your study time to allow a few large blocks of time for studying material of this course each week. &amp;nbsp;Practicing your ability&amp;nbsp;to work intensively for an extended period of time is&amp;nbsp;a skill that will help you in the midterm and final&amp;nbsp;exams, and also more generally in other classes and your work beyond Penn State.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The standards for the&amp;nbsp;course quizzes, papers and project&amp;nbsp;will be clear; in particular, written standards for the course&amp;nbsp;papers&amp;nbsp;will be high. &amp;nbsp;We will provide specific guidance on how to write a science essay. &amp;nbsp;It is important to realize that this is quite different from other forms of writing such as persuasive or creative writing. Even if you are already well-versed in some forms of writing, you should expect to work to deveop&amp;nbsp;skill at writing a scientific essay.&amp;nbsp;You are encouraged to interact with Dr. Ford as you research and draft your papers, to focus on clear factual communication and not get overly distracted in details. &amp;nbsp;Writing a strong essay requires time, often significantly more time than one initially thinks. &amp;nbsp;Therefore, please be sure to&amp;nbsp;allow significantly more time than you think you will need to draft and revise your papers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don't fall behind&lt;/strong&gt;. Procrastination can quickly lead to a situation from which it may be very difficult to recover. Please, do not wait until the last minute to prepare for exams or write papers. &amp;nbsp;Many students have to work hard to master the material. &amp;nbsp;That takes time. &amp;nbsp;If you do not allow sufficient time, then it may become impractical to do well in the course.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three study habits that will maximize your chances for success in your online class:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1.&amp;nbsp; &lt;strong&gt;Devote sufficient time and effort&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;every week&lt;/strong&gt;. Time-on-task is a necessary condition for learning. Schedule&amp;nbsp; blocks of time during each week to study the text, to work on assignments, and to read and contribute to discussions / meetings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2.&amp;nbsp; &lt;strong&gt;Approach learning reflectively&lt;/strong&gt;. Be aware of your strengths and weakness as a learner, and spend time each week focusing on areas where you want ot improve. Students&amp;nbsp; who are able to relate what they learned to situations outside the classroom (real or virtual) are most likely to retain that knowledge. After each lesson ask yourself questions like, "what did I do well?", "what can I improve?", "how did my work/actions affect the people on my team?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. &lt;strong&gt;Review and reinforce your learning each week&lt;/strong&gt;, looking over the previous week's material, and earlier lessons if appropriate, and connecting it to what you are learning this week. The course outline should help you to place each week's readings in a larger context. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;h2&gt;Major Bodies&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sun, Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Asteroid Belt, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, Kuiper Belt Objects (including Pluto and other dwarf planets).&amp;nbsp;Below are real-color images of the Sun (left only) and all the planets including the Jovian (gas giant) planets and the terrestrial planets. Note how Earth and Venus are about the same size, while the other terrestrial planets Mars and Mercury are smaller. Note how the outer gas giants are far bigger than the inner terrestrial planets, with Jupiter and Saturn dominating. &amp;nbsp;The following composite image shows the Sun, planets and principal moons with correct scale in radius, although incorrect scale in orbital spacing. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;img alt="" src="/_legacy/astro140/SolarSystem.png" style="width: 1200px; height: 93px; "&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can visualize planetary orbits with a&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://order.ph.utexas.edu/clock/"&gt;digital orrery&lt;/a&gt;. Set `Draw orbits' and click `Forward' repeatedly. Note how the inner planets orbit faster ... this is Kepler's Third Law, P&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;= a&lt;sup&gt;3&amp;nbsp;&lt;/sup&gt;(the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the orbit size). The configuration of the orbits right now can be found&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.fourmilab.ch/cgi-bin/Solar"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;nbsp;While the terrestrial planets have few moons (Earth has one large moon, Mars has two small ones captured from the Asteroid Belt), the Jovian planets are orbited by an endless number of small bodies. &amp;nbsp;See&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.windows.ucar.edu/tour/link=/our_solar_system/moons_table.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;a table of 174 named moons with links to photos and more information.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 19px; line-height: 24px;"&gt;History&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn are easily seen with the naked eye and have been known since antiquity. In the late-1600s, Isaac Newton Laws of Motion and Gravity, combined with the methods of calculus he invented, gave a quantitative understanding of the elliptical orbits and masses of the planets and their moons. Uranus was discovered with a telescope by amateur German astronomer William Herschel in 1781, later appointed Royal Astronomer of England. &amp;nbsp;Neptune was discovered in 1846 in France based on predictions using Newton's celestial mechanics. Astronomers detected small deviations in the Uranus from an ellipse and correctly inferred that the&amp;nbsp;non-elliptical motion was due to the pull of a then-unknown planet. The first asteroid in the Asteroid Belt between Mars and Jupiter, Ceres, was discovered by accident in 1801. &amp;nbsp;At the time they were considred new planets. &amp;nbsp;Subsequently, tens of thousands of asteroids have been discovered and have well characterized orbits. &amp;nbsp;Now, it's obvious that Ceres and other large asteroids fit are more naturally categorized as members of an asteroid belt&amp;nbsp;than as planets. &amp;nbsp;Altogether, the discovery of the outer Solar System bodies caused tremendous excitement throughout Europe during the 18th and 19th centuries, giving confidence both in the improved technology of telescopes, in the theoretical predictions of Newton's `celestial mechanics', and in the rationality of the world around us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond Neptune are many minor bodies collectively known as Kuiper Belt Objects (KBOs), most discovered since the 1990s. The most famous is Pluto, discovered in the U.S. in 1930 based on perturbations of Uranus' orbit after long searching. Michael Brown (at Caltech in California) and Devid Jewitt (at University of Hawaii) and others have found hundreds of KBOs, and new large surveys are planned to find many more. &amp;nbsp;A few years ago, the International Astronomical Union `demoted' Pluto from `planet' to `drawf planet' status because several KBOs comparable or larger in size have been found.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</body>

    <title>Life on Mars</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;Our LUBS text gives an excellent and detailed treatment of the possibility of life on Mars in Chapter 8. &amp;nbsp;Please read sections 8.1-8.4. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Historical Perspective&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enthusiasm for the possibility—even certitude—that life exists on Mars has persisted for centuries. Below left is a typical image of Mars obtainable from a ground-based telescope. &amp;nbsp;In the late-1800s, Giovanni Schiaperelli claimed he saw `canals', and in a series of popular books, Percival Lowell (1895-1908) proclaimed that they represented constructions of an advanced civilization dying of thirst. &amp;nbsp;In 1898, author and futurist H. G. Wells wrote a popular novel about an invasion of Earth by technologically advanced Martians. &amp;nbsp;This was recouped in 1938 in a radio drama by Orson Welles that caused widespread panic. &amp;nbsp;It was not until NASA's robotic flybys (1960s) and landers (Viking missions, 1970s) that is was completely established that no large forms of life is present on Mars; &amp;nbsp;thousands of pictures have been returned from the Martian surface, and no Martian animals, plants, footprints or other indications of large life forms is seen. The controversy today is whether there is microbial life, or fossils of past life from an era when the climate was warmer and liquid water was prevalent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="text-align: center; "&gt;&lt;img alt="High quality photo of Mars from a ground-based telescope" class="lightbox" src="/_legacy/astro140/mars2.jpg" style="width: 40%;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;img alt="Drawings of Mars by Percival Lowell claiming to show changing canals" class="lightbox" src="/_legacy/astro140/lowell_mars_channels.jpg" style="width: 50%;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="text-align: center; "&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 style="text-align: left; "&gt;Evidence for Liquid Water in Mars' Past&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our class on&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;The terrestrial planets&lt;/em&gt; in our&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Review of our Solar System&lt;/em&gt;, we described many surface features of Mars indicating liquid water was present in the past: &amp;nbsp;streambeds flowing from overfilled craters; craters surrounded by mud flows; dry meandering riverbeds; lake shorelines; gullies around the Valle Marineris canyon system; scarps (cliffs) around the base of Mons Olympus. &amp;nbsp;Recent rovers making close-up studies of the Martian landscape found ripple patterns in rock; sedimentary layers of rock; carbonates (like limestone) and ball-shaped hematite minerals that can only form under water. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Read some of the incredible findings about water on Mars released during the last few months including &lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/MRO/news/mro20110804.html"&gt;seasonal changes&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;in gullies, a layer of &lt;a href="http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.cfm?release=2011-377&amp;cid=release_2011-377"&gt;gypsum&lt;/a&gt; (calcium sulfate with water, CaSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;-2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O), and radar indications of a former large &lt;a href="http://www.marstoday.com/news/viewpr.html?pid=35969"&gt;ocean&lt;/a&gt;. One research group estimates that Mars has been &lt;a href="http://www.marstoday.com/news/viewpr.html?pid=35954"&gt;dry for ~600 million years&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;nbsp;See also photos relating to water on Mars in our LUBS text, pp. 271-276.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If water once flowed on Mars, the temperature of its surface and atmosphere must have been considerably warmer than it is today. &amp;nbsp;This is likely due to an increased greenhouse effect from more carbon dioxide and other gases (water? methane? sulfur dioxide? nitrous oxide?) in the past. &amp;nbsp;Several causes for the gradual loss of warming atmosphere may be involved: &amp;nbsp;the ablation (stripping away) of Mars' atmosphere by the Sun's wind; the destruction of water (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) by the Sun's ultraviolet radiation and subsequent loss of hydrogen to space; ejection due to the explosions from large asteroid impacts; the end of active volcanism as the planet cooled and crust thickened; changes in the planet's obliquity (axis of rotation). &amp;nbsp;See LUBS sec 8.3 for discussion of these possibilities, but our understanding of Mars' ancient climate is still quite uncertain and is actively studied today. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Professor James Kasting in Penn State's College of Earth and Mineral Sciences is one of the world's distinguished scholars studying the atmospheres and climates of the terrestrial planets. Review a talk Jim gave to astronomy undergraduates in 2008 on the &lt;a href="/_legacy/astro140/kasting_early_mars_climate.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;early warming of Mars&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Evidence for Life of Mars&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We really have no evidence for life on Mars. &amp;nbsp;No Martian bunny has been photographed on the surface of the planet. &amp;nbsp;While sedimentary rocks have been seen, no fossils of ancient life have yet been photographed. &amp;nbsp;No messages or visits from Martian civilizations have been identified (outside of fictional stories). &amp;nbsp;But with the clear knowledge that liquid water once flowed profusely on Mars, and the presence of carbon dioxide gas in the atmosphere and carbonate minerals in the rock indicating that organic (carbon-based) molecules were present, and of course the presence of sunlight as an energy source, we satisfy the basic conditions for the emergence of living organisms discussed in our last lesson (&lt;em&gt;General Considerations&lt;/em&gt;). &amp;nbsp;There is, thus, intense interest today in establishing whether life once was present on Mars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the late-1970s, NASA launched two excellent probes that landed softly on Mars (although, unlike more recent probes, they did not have wheels and the ability to move) and provided our first close-up view of the Martian surface. &amp;nbsp;These Viking landers had a robotic shovel that scooped up soil and placed in into three small laboratories specifically designed to search for active life forms (see LUBS p. 281-2). &amp;nbsp;The results were tantalizing! &amp;nbsp;When Martian soil is placed into water, it fizzes, absorbing carbon dioxide and releasing oxygen just like green plants on Earth. &amp;nbsp;However, a mass spectrometer experiment revealed no organic molecules at all. &amp;nbsp;These apparently contradictory results have been explained as the consequence of the Sun's ultraviolet light irradiating the soil giving rise to suboxide or peroxide minerals. &amp;nbsp;When placed in water, these materials can absorb carbon dioxide and emit oxygen ... but without any metabolism of living organisms (analogous to the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxjb2UJZ-5I" style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; "&gt;fizzing&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;of a common treatment for stomach distress). &amp;nbsp;See more details from the &lt;a href="http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/O/OyamaHypoth.html"&gt;Encyclopedia of Science website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="text-align: center; "&gt;&lt;a href="/_legacy/astro140/viking_lander_model.jpg" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img alt="Model of NASA's Viking landers from the 1970s" class="lightbox" src="/_legacy/astro140/viking_lander_model.jpg" style="width: 34%;"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="/_legacy/astro140/vikinglander1-2.jpg" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img alt="Typical photo by the Viking 1 lander" class="lightbox" src="/_legacy/astro140/vikinglander1-2.jpg" style="width: 28%;"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="/_legacy/astro140/vikinglander2-2.jpg" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img alt="Typical photo from the Viking 2 lander" class="lightbox" src="/_legacy/astro140/vikinglander2-2.jpg" style="width: 28%;"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is one other curiosity. &amp;nbsp;Telescopes in Hawaii have taken infrared spectra of the Martian atmosphere for many years. &amp;nbsp;In 2003, &lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/mars/news/marsmethane.html"&gt;methane&lt;/a&gt; was seen over localized regions of the northern hemisphere during its summer. &amp;nbsp;Methane on Mars should be rapidly (few years) destroyed by solar ultraviolet ... so where did it come from? Is it from the ancient atmosphere, trapped in the rock for billions of years and suddenly released? &amp;nbsp;Or, as on Earth, is the methane generated by microbial life? &amp;nbsp;This puzzle has not been solved. &amp;nbsp;A new probe by NASA, the &lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/msl"&gt;Mars Science Lander&lt;/a&gt; (nicknamed Curiosity), is on its way to Mars and should land in August 2012. &amp;nbsp; It has a variety of advanced experiments specifically to look for microbial life. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Habitability of Icy Moons</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="270" src="https://psu.voicethread.com/app/player/?threadId=6131798" width="480"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This commentary accompanies Chapters 4 and 5 of our text, An Introduction to Astrobiology&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Section 4.1: Introduction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a long introduction to the outer icy moons of the Solar System that you do not have to read in great detail. &amp;nbsp;I covered this on a simpler level in the &lt;em&gt;Review of the Solar System&lt;/em&gt; class. &amp;nbsp;The photos of the moons are excellent (Figures 4.4-7 and 4.10-12) as well as the models of their interiors (Figures 4.13-14). &amp;nbsp;The surfaces show enormous variation: from ancient cratered ice to young smooth icy, to stange patterns from (re)melting episodes and volcanoes on Io. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I entirely agree with the first sentences of the chapter: &amp;nbsp;prior to the fly-by missions of the Voyager probes in the 1980s, there was little expectation of liquids needed for life anywhere in the Solar System beyond Mars. The reason is simply temperature: the Sun's light is so faint at these distances that no body's surface can reach the melting temperature of water. &amp;nbsp;Scientists expected that the moons would either be rocky like the asteroids, or icy with ancient frozen surfaces, showing only craters from many asteroid impacts. &amp;nbsp;Jupiter's biggest moon, Callisto (Fig 4.10), is a good example of this, as well as many smaller Jovian moons. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: left; "&gt;It was thus a big surprise when Voyager found several moons with young, active surfaces, showing few impact craters. Understanding these moons was a major motivation for the complex and expensive missions of the 2000s: the NASA's Galileo probe, which orbited within Jupiter's system, and European Space Agency's (ESA's) Cassini mission that is still orbiting within Saturn's system. &amp;nbsp;Jupiter's innermost moon, Io, nearly entirely melted by tidal stresses, has many active volcanoes that perpetually cover the surface with new material.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: left; "&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Section 4.2: Europa&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: left; "&gt;But it was Jupiter's moon Europa (and similarly, Ganymede) that seemed most relevant to the search for life in the Solar System. It has a water ice surface like Callisto, but very few craters. &amp;nbsp;The reflective surface must have been melted and refrozen. &amp;nbsp;The strange grooves, rough patches, and&amp;nbsp;multicolored ice suggest that this melting is a recurrent process, not from a single violent event. Dark ice fills some grooves and patches on the surface (photo below and the many figures in the text). &amp;nbsp;This suggests that the ice covering is not very thick, and liquid (or slushy) water lies below and wells up when the surface cracks. &amp;nbsp;The rough patches on the surface (chaotic terrain) may be the product of ice plates grinding against each other, similar to mountain-building on Earth due to plate tectonics.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="text-align: left; "&gt;This requires that Europa have a liquid water layer beneath a relatively thin ice crust. &amp;nbsp;This is supported by the presence of a weak magnetic field around Europa. &amp;nbsp;What keeps it above freezing temperature? &amp;nbsp;Perhaps it is tidal forces (weaker than Io's) due to its slightly elliptical orbit and perturbations by other moons. &amp;nbsp;Perhaps large impacts episodically melt the interior. &amp;nbsp;The thickness of the ice crust and the water ocean is quite uncertain; below are two models for Europa's interior. &amp;nbsp;NASA engineers and scientists have conceptually designed a mission that would land on Europa with a probe that would melt its way through the ice and swim in the hidden ocean. &amp;nbsp;But this &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPCpNlVJBr8"&gt;ice-penetrating robot mission&lt;/a&gt; has not been approved by NASA or Congress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: left; "&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Section 4.2 on Europa is 24 pages long, and you do not have to know it all. &amp;nbsp;However, in Quiz #3 I will ask for a 1 paragraph essay about Europa's surface which you should prepare in advance from this section. &amp;nbsp;Detailed information and explanation will be expected.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: left; "&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Section 4.5: Other icy moons&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: left; "&gt;Jupiter's moon Europa is not the only one that appears to have melted interior. &amp;nbsp;Neptune's moon Triton is bizarre, half covered with an ancient cratered surface and have with a smooth uncratered surface. &amp;nbsp;Perhaps it collided with another moon and partially melted. &amp;nbsp;Saturn's moon Enceladus shows some craters, but also has discolorations and grooves. &amp;nbsp;Here the Cassini probe has photographed geysers (essentially water volcanoes) along a long ridge. &amp;nbsp;As with Europa, this can be explained only if the surface ice is relatively thin and a (partially) melted layer lies below. &amp;nbsp;Here are some photos of Enceladus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="text-align: left; "&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="/_legacy/astro140/titan_cassini.jpg" style="text-align: center;" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img alt="Titan seen in visible light by the Cassini mission" class="lightbox" src="/_legacy/astro140/titan_cassini.jpg" style="width: 276px;"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="text-align: center;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="/_legacy/astro140/titan_fulldisk_cassini.jpg" style="color: rgb(0, 98, 160); text-decoration: underline; text-align: center;" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img alt="Full disk of Saturn's moon Titan showing the surface in infrared light, photographed by the Cassini probe" class="lightbox" src="/_legacy/astro140/titan_fulldisk_cassini.jpg" style="width: 345px;"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: left; "&gt;We finally come to Saturn's moon Titan, the largest in the Solar System. &amp;nbsp;It was already known from ground-based studies that it is the only moon with its own atmosphere, mostly nitrogen (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) with some methane (CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) and other hydrocarbons. &amp;nbsp;Take a look at its spectrum in the infrared band shown in Figure 5.8, and recall our discussion early in the semester how different molecules have rotational and vibrational states defined by quantum mechanics. &amp;nbsp;The complicated jagged spectral features are from transitions between these quantized states, and from the spectrum astrochemists can determine the composition of Titan's atmosphere. &amp;nbsp;The answer is given in Table 5.3. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: left; "&gt;Section 5.3 then describes how many of these molecules can be formed from a simpler original composition of (say) methane. &amp;nbsp;Some of the chemical reactions would commonly occur on Earth, such as the conbining of two methanes to form ethane (equation 5.5). &amp;nbsp;But other reactions require more unusual molecules such as CH (equation 5.6). &amp;nbsp;These arise when chemical bonds are broken by ultraviiolet light from the (rather faint and distant) Sun. &amp;nbsp;Reactions involving CH lead to other rarer species such as ethene and ethyne (equation 5.6), and then long chain hydrocarbons (eequations 5.9-5.10). &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: left; "&gt;Chemists know a lot about such molecules, including the pressures and temperatures where they are in gaseous, liquid or frozen states (see Box 3.3 on p. 92). The pressure and temperature structure of titan's atmosphere was directly measured by the Huyghens probe launched onto the surface by the Cassini satellite in 2005 (Figure 5.13). &amp;nbsp;Combining laboratory &amp;nbsp;measurements of these chemicals with the Titan atmosphere measurements, we find that methane (CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) and ethane (C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;), which are in high abundance in the atmosphere, should be liquid at Titan's surface temperature and pressure. &amp;nbsp;This explains why the Cassini mission found liquid streams and lakes on Titan: methane-ethane lakes evaporate, producing methane-ethane clouds that rain, forming streams that flow back into the lakes ... just like water on Earth has lakes and oceans that evaporate, produce rain that forms rivers that flow back into the oceans (section 5.4.1). &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: left; "&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="/_legacy/astro140/titan_descent.jpg" style="text-align: center;" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img alt="Photo of methane streams on Titan, photographed by Cassini's Huyghens probe as it parachuted to the surface" src="/_legacy/astro140/titan_descent.jpg" style="width: 276px;"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;span style="text-align: center;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="/_legacy/astro140/titan_surface.png" style="color: rgb(0, 98, 160); text-decoration: underline; text-align: center;" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img alt="A photo from the surface of Titan showing rocks in a `muddy' soil (the liquid is probably methane)" class="lightbox" src="/_legacy/astro140/titan_surface.png" style="width: 207px;"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: left; "&gt;Thus, chemistry and astronomy together explain the remarkable liquids on Titan's surface. &amp;nbsp;The surface cannot be seen in visible light due to the thick clouds, but the Huyghens probe took a few photos as it pararchuted onto the surface (section 5.4.3) and the orbiting Cassini satellite obtains detailed maps of the surface in infrared light and radar reflectance (section 5.4.4). &amp;nbsp;I find these images to be totally amazing! &amp;nbsp;On Earth, liquid methane is called LNG, liquified natural gas, and is used as a fuel. &amp;nbsp;Titan seems to have a full climate with polar methane ice caps, methane clouds and rainstorms, rivers and lakes, and dunes. &amp;nbsp;Cassini has traced a seasonal cycle involving warming with lake evaporation, and cooling with expanding ice caps. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: left; "&gt;Finally, our text explains that methane cannot survive long on Titan due to photodissociation (breaking apart) by solar ultraviolet (section 5.4.1). &amp;nbsp;So there should be some source of methane to continuously replenish the atmosphere and lakes (section 5.4.5). &amp;nbsp;One possibility, still not confirmed, is volcanoes releasing methane from the moon's interior. &amp;nbsp;While we are not sure this is occurring, we do see cryovolcanoes (ice-volcanoes) on Neptune's moon Triton, and of course on Jupiter's Io.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: left; "&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Life on Titan?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: left; "&gt;One can only speculate whether life can arise on Titan's surface where the temperature is around 90&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; K (ninety degrees above absolute zero). &amp;nbsp;Recent laboratory experiments (similar to the Miller-Urey experiments for early Earth) indicate that amino acids and nucleic acids, critical components of proteins and DNA, could form if the temperature were hotter. &amp;nbsp;Astronomers note that, in a few billion years, the Sun will become a red giant star, boiling water on Earth but warming Titan to more habitable temperatures. &amp;nbsp;Altogether, after Earth, Titan seems to have the best chance for life in the Solar System with a solid surface, carbon-rich chemistry, a liquid solvent, and ecological variety. &amp;nbsp;NASA recently approved funds for preliminary study of a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titan_Mare_Explorer"&gt;Titan Mare Explorer&lt;/a&gt; that would splash-land in one of its methane lakes and study its chemistry. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We thus find that, contrary to any reasonable expectation before detailed study with robotic probes, that some Jovian moons have liquid on (or close to) their surfaces. &amp;nbsp;Europa and similar moons have water oceans below their ice coverings, and Titan has incredible liquid hydrocarbon lakes on its surface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is likely that, in coming decades, humans will send more probes to the icy moons of the outer Solar System to study them further ... and look for primitive live forms.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</body>

    <title>The Anthropic Principle</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;For several decades, some astrophysicists have discussed arguments that the observed conditions of the physical Universe are closely linked in some way to the existence of living organisms such as ourselves. The sizes, masses and ages of objects we see (atoms, living organisms, planets, stars, galaxies, Universe) can all be related to a few basic physical constants: the relative strengths of gravitational, electrical, atomic and nuclear forces; the relative masses of protons and electrons; and parameters of cosmology. The existence of these objects thus places constraints on these elementary physical constants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;"The possibility of life as we know it evolving in the Universe depends on the values of a few basic physical constants—and is in some respects remarkably sensitive to their numerical values.'' (Carr &amp; Rees, 1979)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, the existence of life on silicate + water planets requires that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;the universal expansion following the Big Bang is tuned to produce long-lived gravitationally collapsed structures.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;the ratio of light to particles in the Universe is sufficiently low to permit particles to form neutral atoms and permit gravitational collapse of stars.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;the constants of nuclear physics are tuned to give long-lived main sequence phases of stars and red giants that synthesize heavy elements.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Together, such requirements place stringent constraints on the fundamental constants of nature, sometimes constraining them to with a few percent of their observed values. These arguments can be made in considerable detail. Here are some details:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;If the expansion after the Big Bang was weaker than we observe (with other cosmological conditions left the same), then the Universe would expand only briefly before recollapsing. Long-lived stars and planets would not have time to exist. If the Big Bang were stronger than it was, particles would be dispersed before gravity could collect them into galaxies and stars. This requires a delicate balance of Dark Matter and Dark Energy.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;If the nuclear isotope of lithium 3Li were stable, then the fusion of 4 1H --&gt; 4He would proceed directly and quickly in the cores of stars, and the main sequence phase would not last billions of years.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;If the carbon nucleus 12C had an energy state just below -- instead of just above -- the energy of a beryllium 8Be energy state, then red giant nucleosynthesis would end at beryllium and heavier elements such as carbon or oxygen would be rare.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;If Newton's law of gravity were F = GMm/r2.1 rather than GMm/r2.0, then there would be no stable orbits of a planet around a star.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These arguments are known as the Anthropic Principle. Several variations are discussed (weak Anthropic Principle, strong Anthropic Principle, final Anthropic Principle, etc). Many scientists dislike these arguments intensely: they seem post hoc, where observed phenomena somehow act backward in time on past conditions. How could the existence of humans 13 billion years after the formation of the Universe affect its properties?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the problems of reverse causation are partly resolved if one considers the possibility of many Universes, each with different physical properties. Then, life would exist only in those with the necessary conditions; most universes would not have living organisms. The Many Universes Hypothesis (or multiverse) is now considered seriously by astrophysicists in the context of the latest theories of quantum relativity and inflationary cosmology. Perhaps Universes emerge from some quantum foam of virtual Universes? Perhaps the transition from inflation to ordinary expansion results occurs separately in different regions, each of which produces a Big Bang with different properties? Perhaps there `are' (in some sense of existence) many Universes within which only a very few have the carefully tuned conditions necessary for life. Of course, we must live in one of these rare Universes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The anthropic principle is briefly discussed by LUBS pp. 69-70.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    <title>Interlude: Understanding Molecules</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;To pursue our study of live in the universe, we first need to introduce some concepts and information about atoms, molecules and light. `Atoms' are tiny entities with a dense nucleus of protons and neutrons surrounded by a cloud of electrons. The number of protons defines the element: 1 = hydrogen, 2 = helium, …, 6 = carbon, 7 = nitrogen, 8 = oxygen, …, 26 = iron, and so on. A collection of atoms can be called a gas cloud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the cloud is hot, two atoms that collide will bounce off each other because the electron clouds (both negatively charges) repel each other. But when a cloud is cold and the collisions are slow and the two atoms can form a weak, but stable, bond. This occurs when the attraction of the protons is slightly stronger than the repulsion of the electrons. These entity of two or more atoms bonded together is called a `molecule'. `Chemistry' is the science devoted to the behavior and reactions between molecules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/_legacy/astro140/carbon_atom_diagram.png" rel="lightbox[][Diagram of a carbon atom]"&gt;&lt;img alt="Diagram of a carbon atom" src="/_legacy/astro140/carbon_atom_diagram.png" style="width: 300px; height: 250px;" title="Diagram of a carbon atom"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="/_legacy/astro140/water_molecule_diagram.jpg" rel="lightbox[][Diagram of a water molecule]"&gt;&lt;img alt="Diagram of a water molecule" src="/_legacy/astro140/water_molecule_diagram.png" style="width: 400px; height: 331px;" title="Diagram of a water molecule"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/_legacy/astro140/water.gif" rel="lightbox[][Diagram of a water molecule showing the chemical bonds]"&gt;&lt;img alt="Diagram of a water molecule showing the chemical bonds" src="/_legacy/astro140/water.gif" style="width: 96px; height: 91px;" title="Diagram of a water molecule showing the chemical bonds"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &lt;a href="/_legacy/astro140/methane.gif" rel="lightbox[][Methane molecule]"&gt;&lt;img alt="Methane molecule" src="/_legacy/astro140/methane.gif" style="width: 104px; height: 100px;" title="Methane molecule"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;a href="/_legacy/astro140/ammonia.gif" rel="lightbox[][Ammonia molecule]"&gt;&lt;img alt="Ammonia molecule" src="/_legacy/astro140/ammonia.gif" style="width: 104px; height: 91px;" title="Ammonia molecule"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bonds between atoms in a molecule are not entirely fixed. They can stretch and bend in various ways (see fun &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_vibration" target="_blank"&gt;moving diagrams&lt;/a&gt;). Even at very cold temperatures, the molecules can rotate. But the behavior of atoms and molecules is not like the behavior of large objects we experience in our daily lives. Large objects can move in a smooth fashion where any energy is possible. But tiny objects follow the rules of `quantum mechanics' and can be in only a fixed number of distinct energy states. A rotating or vibrating molecule can change its energy state by emitting or absorbing a particular wavelength of light. These wavelengths are generally not in the visible band, but have longer wavelengths in the infrared and microwave bands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, astronomers can observe the sky using specialized telescopes and look for emission or absorption lines at particular wavelengths associated with the quantum transitions of specific molecules. Even for simple molecules, these patterns of spectral lines can be very complicated, often blurring together to form messy bands. But they are unique for each molecule: just as a crime investigator can identify a person from a unique fingerprint, an astronomer can identify a molecule from its unique pattern of microwave and infrared emission lines. The study of the spectral lines and patterns produced by different molecules is called "molecular spectroscopy."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are infrared spectra for three common molecules: water, carbon dioxide, and ethanol (the alcohol in wine and beer). To show why this is relevant to our search for live in the universe, we show the infrared spectra of three familiar planets in our Solar System. We see that Venus, Earth and Mars all have carbon dioxide in their atmospheres, but only Earth has abundant water and oxygen (inferred from it chemical byproduct, O3 or ozone).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/_legacy/astro140/500px-infrared_spectra_of_water_carbon_dioxide_and_ethanol_.jpg" rel="lightbox[][Infrared spectra of three important molecules:  water, carbon dioxide, ethanol]"&gt;&lt;img alt="Infrared spectra of three important molecules:  water, carbon dioxide, ethanol" src="/_legacy/astro140/500px-infrared_spectra_of_water_carbon_dioxide_and_ethanol_.jpg" style="width: 500px; height: 463px;" title="Infrared spectra of three important molecules:  water, carbon dioxide, ethanol"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;a href="/_legacy/astro140/terrestrial-spectra.jpg" rel="lightbox[][Observed infrared spectra of three planets: Venus, Earth and Mars]"&gt;&lt;img alt="Observed infrared spectra of three planets: Venus, Earth and Mars" src="/_legacy/astro140/terrestrial-spectra.jpg" style="width: 694px; height: 843px;" title="Observed infrared spectra of three planets: Venus, Earth and Mars"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To discover the molecular material from which planets (and eventually living organisms) form, we have to study the sky with infrared and microwave telescopes. Below are photos of important telescopes at the three bands: the Gemini telescope on a Hawaiian mountaintop for visible wavelengths, the Spitzer Space Telescope orbiting the Earth at infrared wavelengths (two photos), and the ALMA (Atacama Large Millimeter Array) now being built on a mountaintop in Chile.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Cosmology: The Story of the Universe</title>
    <body>&lt;h3&gt;Cosmology: The story of the Universe&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We first lay the foundations of Life in the Universe by discussing the Universe as a whole, its origins in a Big Bang ~13 billion years ago and its history until the present day. Big Bang cosmology began in the early-20th century, was largely confirmed by the late-20th century, and is now in an era of detailed investigation, establishing the parameters of the model to ~1% precision. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Modern cosmology is full of unexpected and unintuitive features: a universal expansion (similar to blowing up a balloon); its contents dominated by mysterious Dark Matter and Dark Energy; a clear explanation for the formation of the simplest elements (hydrogen and helium), and the formation of stars and galaxies. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;All societies have a cosmology … an explanation for the origin and development of the world around us. In many traditional cultures, the world is created by deities, gods and goddesses. The previous lecture outlined the rise of modern science, starting with Isaac Newton's mathematical relationships defining the motions and gravitational interactions of physical objects.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;A brilliant young scientist named &lt;a href="http://www.aip.org/history/einstein/"&gt;Albert Einstein&lt;/a&gt; made profound changes to Newtonian physics. First, in 1905, he showed that Newton's laws of motion do not hold when speeds approach the speed of light. He then struggled for a decade to understand gravity in his new context, emerging with the theory of General Relativity in 1915. Based on the view that massive bodies alter the geometry of 4-dimensional space-time, Einstein's General Relativity gives a full and accurate explanation of the gravitational attraction between bodies. The mathematics was quickly applied to the universe as a whole by the Russian physicist &lt;a href="http://www.pbs.org/wnet/hawking/universes/html/fried.html"&gt;Alexander Friedmann&lt;/a&gt; and Belgian astronomer Georges Lemaitre. He found that the theory predicts that the Universe should not be static: it should either expand or contract following specific mathematical formulae. Remember that this is not a vague idea, but a rigorous mathematical derivation based on Einstein's General Relativity. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In the early 20th century, astronomers knew only about stars relatively near the Sun in the Milky Way. But there were some blurry objects in the sky known as `nebulae'. Around 1920, a talented American astronomer names&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/aso/databank/entries/bahubb.html" style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; "&gt;Edwin Hubble&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;used a giant new telescope in California to obtain improved photographs of the nebulae. Some appeared to be huge, but very distant, structures similar to the Milky Way. With repeated observations of the nebula Messier 31 in the Andromeda constellation, Hubble demonstrated it was a distinct `island universe', or galaxy. He and others photographed many other galaxies.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Astronomers obtained spectra of these galaxies to measure their motions towards or away from us based on the Doppler shift. To everyone's amazement, nearly all galaxies showed a redshift indicating they are all moving away from us. Furthermore, the redshift is greater for more distant galaxies, following a linear relationship v = H&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; d (Hubble's law). The only reasonable interpretation for all galaxies moving away from us in a linear fashion is that space itself is expanding, much like the rubber surface on a balloon expands as it is inflated. The diagrams below show the original data available to Hubble, a modern dataset combining data from several methods for estimating galaxy distances, and the `raisin bread' analogy to explain the redshift law. By the middle of the 20th century, nearly all astronomers acknowledged that we reside in an expanding universe that follows the predictions of Einstein's General Relativity.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Hubble original data leading to his derivation of the linear relationship between galaxy distance and recessional velocity (redshift).  Note he could measure only the nearest galaxies out to v~1000 km/s.." class="lightbox" src="/_legacy/astro140/1305.jpg" style="width: 259px; height: 174px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="A modern `Hubble diagram' made with much better telescopes and detectors than Hubble had.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="The `raisin bread' analogy of the Expanding Universe that exhibits Hubble's law between the raisins.  " class="lightbox" src="/_legacy/astro140/1504.jpg" style="width: 328px; height: 131px;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;If the universe is really expanding, then the galaxies were closer together and the average density of matter was higher in the past. Extrapolating to earlier times, there must be some instant when the expansion began, after which the density of the universe was extremely high. High densities imply high temperatures for normal matter. When dense matter is hot it radiates light with a `blackbody' spectrum. So the expanding universe model predicts:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;the universe was formed in a Big Bang at a single instant. With the latest measurement of Hubble's contestant, H0=73 km/s/Mpc and other parameters, the Big Bang occurred about 13.7 billion years ago.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;the early universe just after the Big Bang was filled with light and particles at extremely high temperatures&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;the Universe should be suffused with light from the Big Bang following a black body spectrum&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In the 1950s, physicist George Gamow calculated that the light from the Big Bang should cool as the universe expands, and should be a few degrees above absolute zero today. In the mid-1960s, this cosmic light was discovered, by accident, by Arno Pensias and Robert Wilson. They were working for Bell Laboratories (the U.S. telephone company) to investigate why static was present on long-distance telephone calls that used microwave signals. They found that the entire sky was the source of the radiation. This `cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation was immediately associated with Gamow's predicted light from the Big Bang.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The discovery of the CMB was a powerful confirmation of the Big Bang model for the expanding universe. It was found to have exactly a blackbody spectrum with T=2.735 K, about 3 degrees above absolute zero. Other predictions of the model were also validated during the 1960s-70s. Exactly 24% of the hydrogen was converted to helium, with trace amounts of deuterium, lithium and beryllium isotopes. The age of the oldest stars is close to the 13.7 billion years since the Big Bang.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Today, detailed studies of the CMB, galaxies, galaxy clusters, and other extragalactic phenomena (such as quasars and gravitational lensing) all support a particular version of the Big Bang model. Here only 4% of the `stuff' in the universe is regular matter: molecules made up of atoms, themselves made up of protons, neutrons and electrons. 72% is composed of a mysterious `Dark Energy' that is accelerating the universe's expansion, and 23% is comprised of a different mysterious Dark Matter that slows the expansion. However, many of these fascinating findings of modern cosmology do not directly affect our understanding of Life in the Universe. We will concern ourselves here only with regular matter from which stars, planets and biospheres are made.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Milky Way Galaxy</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Galaxies: The home of stars and planets &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though the Universe has been expanding since the Big Bang, dispersing the atoms and cooling the light, gravity is still present. On local scales, atoms attracted each other, forming early stars and then galaxies. We have little observational knowledge about this phase of the Universe&amp;#39;s history, hence its nickname `the Dark Ages&amp;#39;. It lasted roughly from 1 million to 1 billion years after the Big Bang, or the first few percent of the Universe&amp;#39;s current age. Astrophysicists argue that an early generation of stars formed during this time, quickly going supernova and polluting the gas with small amounts of elements heavier than helium. Detailed models show that gravitational attraction (involving both Dark Matter and regular matter) produced dense sheets and filaments that then collapsed to form galaxies and galaxy clusters. Big galaxies cannibalize smaller ones, and mergers of big galaxies are common. Massive black holes formed at the center of most galaxies at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Take a look at recent computer simulations of gravitational collapse in the expanding Universe. These are very complicated calculations based on the latest cosmological model (with Dark Matter and Dark Energy) requiring the world&amp;#39;s most powerful computers.&amp;nbsp; The first&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C_dnP2fvxk" style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; "&gt;movie&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;(1 min) shows a calculation the formation of large-scale structure from the University of Chicago. The second&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://vimeo.com/23221987" style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; "&gt;movie&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;(2 min) is a similar calculation from University of California showing good agreement with the latest observations from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While galaxy collisions still occur occasionally today, ~12 billion years after the violent Dark Ages, most galaxies are quiet and stable, serenely spinning through space. Most large galaxies have a flattened disk with a pinwheel pattern of `spiral arms&amp;#39; where stars and planets form. See the photos above of nearby spiral galaxies, including own Milky Way Galaxy. Because the Sun lies in the disk of our Galaxy, we cannot see its structure as we can with distant face-on galaxies. We study the detailed formation of stars and planets in the nearby spiral arms of our Galaxy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center; "&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/_legacy/astro140/milkyway_optical.jpg" style="width: 400px; height: 266px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A composite photo of our Galaxy as seen from Earth is shown above. &amp;nbsp;Note the similarity to NGC 891, another spiral galaxy seen edge-on. Below is an artist drawing, consistent with modern observations, showing our Galaxy &amp;nbsp;as it would appear if seen face-on. &amp;nbsp;Note the Sun is about 25,000 light-years (8000 parsecs) from the center, and lies between two spiral arms. The central region of the Galaxy has a large bar, and a modest 3x10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; M&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; massive black hole lies at the very core.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center; "&gt;&lt;img alt="Artist's drawing of our Milky Way Galaxy, seen face on" class="lightbox" src="/_legacy/astro140/milky_way_galaxy_drawing.jpg" style="width: 450px; height: 450px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Interstellar Medium&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The images of the Milky Way (above) and other galaxies (previous page) were made in visible light, the waveband where the surfaces of stars shine. Their temperatures are thousands of degrees Kelvin (above absolute zero). But the dark clouds where stars and planets form are much colder, only tens or hundreds of degrees Kelvin. These `shine&amp;#39; in the microwave and infrared bands of light, and in particular exhibit the emission lines and bands produced by particular molecules. &lt;strong&gt;Read the `Sidebar: Understanding molecules&amp;#39; (next page) for background.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interstellar clouds nearby in the Milky Way can be oddly beautiful in photographs. The first two images below show the Eagle Nebula and the Orion Nebula in visible light, as seen with the Hubble Space Telescope. The Eagle shows dark pillars of cold gas and dust illuminated by a nearby hot star. A few stars (probably with planets) are forming now in these pillars. Orion recently (about 1-2 million years ago) formed a rich cluster of stars (probably with planets). The dark cloud is behind the cluster, and the edge is brightly shining due to heating by the hottest Orion stars. The third image a much larger cloud as viewed in the infrared with the Spitzer Space Telescope. The light here is from vibrations of soot-like hydrocarbon molecules. The final image below shows recent research maps of two emission lines of the ammonia molecule (NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) in a small dark cloud that is likely to form stars soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="text-align: center; "&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center; "&gt;&lt;img alt="A large star forming molecular cloud seen in its infrared emission by the Spitzer Space Telescope." class="lightbox" src="/_legacy/astro140/ssc_eagleneb.jpg" style="width: 40%;" /&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;img alt="Modern research observations of ammonia emssion lines from a small molecular cloud (Freisen et al. 2009).

&lt;p&gt;The result of several decades of molecular spectroscopy of interstellar clouds has shown an amazing variety of molecules in a gas that is mostly hydrogen (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and helium. Most of these molecules are organic; that is, they containing carbon. Some are quite simple molecules: carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), methane (CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), hydrogen cyanide (HCN). But others are more complex: ethane (C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;), ether (CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;OCH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), ethanol (CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OH), acetone (CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CO), acetic acid (CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;COOH), a simple sugar (CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OHCHO), antifreeze (HOCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OH), and controversially, possibly an amino acid (NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;COOH). Some interstellar molecules are not organic (that is, without carbon): water (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O), nitrogen (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), ammonia (NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), hydrochloric acid (HCl), salt (NaCl), sulfur dioxide (SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), and so forth. Some molecules happen to have emission lines at wavelengths that are technically difficult to detect. This is the reason that the oxygen molecule (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) was not discovered until 2011 using the new Herschel Space Telescope.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sidebar: Understanding Molecules</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;To pursue our study of live in the universe, we first need to introduce some concepts and information about atoms, molecules and light. `Atoms' are tiny entities with a dense nucleus of protons and neutrons surrounded by a cloud of electrons. The number of protons defines the element: 1 = hydrogen, 2 = helium, …, 6 = carbon, 7 = nitrogen, 8 = oxygen, …, 26 = iron, and so on. A collection of atoms can be called a gas cloud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the cloud is hot, two atoms that collide will bounce off each other because the electron clouds (both negatively charges) repel each other. But when a cloud is cold and the collisions are slow and the two atoms can form a weak, but stable, bond. This occurs when the attraction of the protons is slightly stronger than the repulsion of the electrons. These entity of two or more atoms bonded together is called a `molecule'. `Chemistry' is the science devoted to the behavior and reactions between molecules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img alt="Diagram of a carbon atom" class="lightbox" src="/_legacy/astro140/carbon_atom_diagram.png" style="width: 30%;"&gt; &lt;img alt="Diagram of a water molecule" class="lightbox" src="/_legacy/astro140/water_molecule_diagram.jpg" style="width: 35%;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img alt="Diagram of a water molecule showing the chemical bonds" class="lightbox" src="/_legacy/astro140/water.gif" style="width: 15%;"&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &lt;img alt="Methane molecule" class="lightbox" src="/_legacy/astro140/methane.gif" style="width: 15%;"&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;img alt="Ammonia molecule" class="lightbox" src="/_legacy/astro140/ammonia.gif" style="width: 15%;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bonds between atoms in a molecule are not entirely fixed. They can stretch and bend in various ways (see fun &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_vibration"&gt;moving diagrams&lt;/a&gt;). Even at very cold temperatures, the molecules can rotate. But the behavior of atoms and molecules is not like the behavior of large objects we experience in our daily lives. Large objects can move in a smooth fashion where any energy is possible. But tiny objects follow the rules of `quantum mechanics' and can be in only a fixed number of distinct energy states. A rotating or vibrating molecule can change its energy state by emitting or absorbing a particular wavelength of light. These wavelengths are generally not in the visible band, but have longer wavelengths in the infrared and microwave bands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, astronomers can observe the sky using specialized telescopes and look for emission or absorption lines at particular wavelengths associated with the quantum transitions of specific molecules. Even for simple molecules, these patterns of spectral lines can be very complicated, often blurring together to form messy bands. But they are unique for each molecule: just as a crime investigator can identify a person from a unique fingerprint, an astronomer can identify a molecule from its unique pattern of microwave and infrared emission lines. The study of the spectral lines and patterns produced by different molecules is called `molecular spectroscopy'.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are infrared spectra for three common molecules: water, carbon dioxide, and ethanol (the alcohol in wine and beer). To show why this is relevant to our search for live in the universe, we show the infrared spectra of three familiar planets in our Solar System. We see that Venus, Earth and Mars all have carbon dioxide in their atmospheres, but only Earth has abundant water and oxygen (inferred from it chemical byproduct, O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; or ozone).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Infrared spectra of three important molecules:  water, carbon dioxide, ethanol" class="lightbox" src="/_legacy/astro140/500px-infrared_spectra_of_water_carbon_dioxide_and_ethanol_.jpg" style="width: 50%;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;img alt="Observed infrared spectra of three planets: Venus, Earth and Mars" class="lightbox" src="/_legacy/astro140/terrestrial-spectra.jpg" style="width: 40%;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To discover the molecular material from which planets (and eventually living organisms) form, we have to study the sky with infrared and microwave telescopes. Below are photos of important telescopes at the three bands: the Gemini telescope on a Hawaiian mountaintop for visible wavelengths, the Spitzer Space Telescope orbiting the Earth at infrared wavelengths (two photos), and the ALMA (Atacama Large Millimeter Array) now being built on a mountaintop in Chile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Stars: Energy for Life</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;On Earth, scientists study the complicated interactions in the world around us, often tracing `cycles' that show how some feature begins, develops, and ends. Some involve physical components (such as the `water cycle': evaporation of water from the oceans, with rain and rivers bringing water back, while some is captured in glaciers and ice caps) while others involve living organisms (such as the life cycle of a human from birth through childhood, adulthood, aging, and death). Similarly, astronomers can trace the physical cycles and interactions in a Galaxy, and of its components (such as the interstellar medium, stars and planets). Here we discuss the life cycle of individual stars. Stars are crucial for life in the universe, as without their heat, planets would be much too cold to sustain life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Star Formation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have seen that, in a spiral galaxy like the Milky Way, a complicated `interstellar medium' resides in the space between stars. It consists of gases (mostly hydrogen and helium from the Big Bang, with a soup of interesting molecules) and tiny solid `dust grains' (some made of rock like tiny sand grains, others made of carbon like soot). As a spiral arm passes through a region in the Galaxy, the interstellar material is compressed and dark cold clouds form. When a cloud of interstellar medium is dense enough, gravity locally dominates other forces and a star forms by `gravitational collapse'. Material with too much spin forms a flattened disk orbiting the protostar; this is the `protoplanetary disk' where planets form. The star and disk formation process is complicated, and astrophysical modeling is underway. &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thus stars, planets, and any life on these planets inherit their molecules from the interstellar medium. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Look at the recent &lt;a href="http://www.astro.ex.ac.uk/people/mbate/Cluster/pr.html"&gt;computer simulations of the star formation process&lt;/a&gt; in a small interstellar cloud by Matthew Bate. The gas in the cloud starts off with random swirling motions known as `turbulence'. Then some clumps undergo gravitational collapse forming stars (white dots), but gas continues to collect. Some stars form in isolation with their disks, but many interact with other young stars and disks in complex ways. A large fraction of stars remain in binary systems. Many stars form in large molecular clouds where hundreds or thousands of stars form together as a &lt;a href="http://www.astro.ex.ac.uk/people/mbate/Cluster/Animations/ClusterXT1810Z_H264B_s.mov"&gt;star cluster&lt;/a&gt;. Here too individual stars often have protoplanetary disks. We will study protoplanetary disks later in the course to understand how diverse types of planetary systems form; this is needed to evaluate how many planets could harbor life similar to Earth's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Stages of Stellar Evolution&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once formed in a molecular cloud, the individual star goes through four major phases of evolution: - `pre-main sequence' powered by release of energy from the gravitational collapse;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;`main sequence' powered by fusion of hydrogen to helium in the core;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;`red giant' powered by fusion of helium to elements up to iron;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;`death processes'. The outer layers of the red giant stars are ejected, slowly or violently, and the inner core becomes one of three types of compact star (`white dwarf', `neutron star', or `black hole').&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The observational evidence for the evolution of a star is often shown on the Hertzsprung-Russell (H-R) diagram. Here we plot the luminosity of the star on the vertical axis (actually, the log of the luminosity since the range of luminosities is so huge), and the surface temperature on the horizontal axis. Recall that `luminosity' has units of energy per second, and measures the intrinsic light output or `power' of a star. A common unit of luminosity is the `watt'; we might have a 60 watt lightbulb in our room, while the Sun today emits 4x10&lt;sup&gt;27&lt;/sup&gt; watts. A protostar in a molecular cloud has a relatively cool surface but is quite luminous, and thus appears in the upper-right part of the H-R diagram. It quickly (not too quickly …. for a 1 M&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; star like the Sun, in ~10 million years) loses power but heats its surface, moving downward and to the left on the diagram below (left).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="The brief pre-main sequence stage of stellar evolution on the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram" class="lightbox" src="/_legacy/astro140/fg11_24.jpg" style="width: 279px; height: 289px;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;img alt="Hertzsprung-Russell diagram showing the post-main sequence evolution of a 1 solar mass star into the red giant regime" class="lightbox" src="/_legacy/astro140/fg12_10_1.jpg" style="width: 256px; height: 299px;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the star reaches the main sequence where the core temperature exceeds ~13 million degrees Kelvin, nuclear reactions begin in the core that fuse hydrogen to helium. In most stars, this is through the `proton-proton chain' with intermediary steps involving rare isotopes of hydrogen and helium. As over 70% of the star is hydrogen, there is a vast supply of fuel for this reaction, keeping stars on the main sequence for (in most cases) billions of years. This is the most stable and long-lived phase of stellar evolution. Our Sun today has been on the main sequence for 4.5 billion years, and will continue hydrogen-to-helium burning steadily for ~6 billion years more. Below is an artist's conception of the interior of the Sun and many other similar main sequence stars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Artist's drawing of the interior of the Sun today as a main sequence star" class="lightbox" src="/_legacy/astro140/cutaway.jpg" style="width: 333px; height: 333px;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Red giant stars: `We are starstuff!' (Carl Sagan)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The red giant phase is particularly important for understanding the origin of elements needed for planets and living organisms. When hydrogen is depleted in the core of the main sequence star (that is, when the core is entirely helium), nuclear burning continues in a shell around the core. When the core reaches ~120 million degrees Kelvin, then helium is not longer stable and can react with itself to form heavier elements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, the helium flash initiates the reaction&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;p&gt;3 &lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;He ---&gt; &lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;C + 2 gamma-rays&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stars like the Sun will then burn hydrogen to helium in a shell around the core where helium is burning to carbon. &amp;nbsp;The star becomes very luminous but the outer layers swell to huge radii and cool. &amp;nbsp;The star thus moves upward and to the right in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Diagram of the interior of the Sun as a red giant" class="lightbox" src="/_legacy/astro140/fg12_07.jpg" style="cursor: default; width: 226px; height: 215px;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;img alt="Hertzsprung-Russell diagram of the evolution of the Sun after the main sequence." class="lightbox" src="/_legacy/astro140/fg12_10.jpg" style="cursor: default; width: 222px; height: 208px;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cores of more massive stars (5-100 M&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;) will be hot enough to burn carbon and other elements up to iron:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;C + &lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;He ---&gt; &lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;br&gt;&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;O + &lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;He ---&gt; &lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt;Ne&lt;br&gt;and similar reactions give &lt;sup&gt;24&lt;/sup&gt;Mg, &lt;sup&gt;28&lt;/sup&gt;Si, &lt;sup&gt;32&lt;/sup&gt; S, ..., &lt;sup&gt;56&lt;/sup&gt;Fe (iron).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These rare high-mass stars become supergiants, the most luminous stars in the Galaxy, during their brief red giant phases. Several nuclear reactions can occur simultaneously in the core and shells around the core (like layers of an onion; see diagram below). Each nuclear reaction releases more energy, so the stars becomes more and more luminous. These are the massive supergiants with luminosities L ~ 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;-10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; L&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Diagram of the interior of a massive star (M&gt;10 solar masses) as a red supergiant." class="lightbox" src="/_legacy/astro140/fg12_17.jpg" style="width: 222px; height: 192px;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iron is the last element that can be made in this fashion because it is the most stable nucleus.&amp;nbsp; That is, any nuclear reaction involving iron requires more enegy than it emits.&amp;nbsp; Iron is thus the end-product of normal stellar nucleosynthesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The synthesis of nuclei in red giants/supergiants explains the relative abundances of different elements in the Universe.&amp;nbsp; The plot below shows that, after hydrogen &amp;&amp;nbsp;helium, the most abundant elements in the Sun are the even-numbered elements between 6 and 26 protons: C, O, Ne, Mg, ... Fe.&amp;nbsp; Note also the rarity of elements heavier than iron. Similar abundances of the elements are seen in other stars, the Galaxy's interstellar medium, Jupiter and elsewhere. This universal pattern is powerful evidence for the theory of red giant stars, and implies that red giants are the main source of elements with 6-26 protons in the Universe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;&lt;img alt="Plot of the relative abundances of the elements in the Universe today.  H and He come from the Big Bang, C through Fe are produced in red giant stars, and the rare heavy elements come from supernova explosions." class="lightbox" src="/_legacy/astro140/elements.jpg" style="width: 350px; height: 285px;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do these atoms formed inside red giant stars get out into the Galaxy? Convection (like boiling) in red giants brings these heavier elements produced in the interior to the surface. There they condense into tiny solid particles of rock (typically Mg-Si-O mixtures) and carbon which are pushed outward into space by the starlight. These explain the interstellar dust particles, which scatter and redden light in the Milky Way. &amp;nbsp;Later, the gas and dust ejected by red giant stars enter cold molecular clouds, where it undergoes gravitational collapse and forms new stars and planets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Thus, the Earth, you and I are composed of C/N/O/Si/Fe/... atoms that were created in red giant stars before our solar system was born.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;The atoms were formed by nuclear reactions in the giant/supergiant phase, ejected into the interstellar medium in both gaseous and solid form, and later incorporated into the solar system, the biosphere and ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"We are made of starstuff'' (Carl Sagan) &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Summary: The astronomical context for life&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this introductory portion of the course, we have found that normal galaxies, forming in complicated ways billions of years ago after the Big Bang, form stars and planets continuously from their interstellar medium. The stars produce elements heavier than helium by nuclear fusion, and these atoms are ejected into the galaxy's interstellar medium. More stars and planets form in the cold interstellar clouds, now enriched with atoms from the furnaces in stars. These atoms combined to form a wide variety of molecules, many containing carbon. Interstellar clouds can be viewed as a laboratory of organic molecules diluted in the dominant hydrogen (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and helium from the Big Bang. These chemicals are familiar to us -- water, molecules in Earth's atmosphere (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), methane and other hydrocarbons, alcohols and sugars. These are the molecules we see in our daily lives on the surface of Earth, the same molecules necessary for living organisms on Earth. We thus have traced profound links between the Universe, the galaxies, the stars, the interstellar medium, star and planet formation, and life on Earth. While some of this story was known ~50 years ago and Carl Sagan outlined it for the public ~30 years ago, many of the findings are very recent. Understanding the molecular universe, in particular, is a strong motivation for the most modern (and expensive) telescopes of the past ~10 years such as the Spitzer and Herschel Space Telescopes and the ALMA in Chile.&lt;/p&gt;</body>

    <title>The Nature of Time</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;In a fundamental way, life in the Universe would not be possible if our universe had not begun in a very peculiar state.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This point is important, and relates to one of the three perspectives on the nature of life that we have been discussing - specifically, the Schroedinger picture of life as a system that resists the decay to thermal equilibrium (for a while). In order to understand the importance of the universe's special initial state, and how it made life in this universe possible, we will have to go back to a very basic question: &amp;nbsp;What is Time?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;What is Time?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are actually two very different ideas of time that we will need to clarify before we can discuss their relationship to life. Let's review these two ideas and see if we can't find a way to reconcile them into a single picture.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 style="text-align: center; "&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/_legacy/astro140/wristwatch.jpg" style="width: 250px; height: 269px;"&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;1. Time is a Dimension&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the first vision, time is a physical dimension of our universe - the dimension we measure with clocks. Just as we can measure the distances between two any two events using a ruler, we can measure the time between any two events using a clock. A "clock", for a scientist, is just any predictably periodic process, for example: &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Motions of the Sun, Moon, and planets&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;The human heartbeat, or pulse&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;The motion of a pendulum, as first pointed out by Galileo&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;The regular motions of an analog wrist watch's springs and ratchets&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;The regular vibrations of a digital wrist watch's quartz crystal&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;The rates of atomic or nuclear transitions, as in "atomic clocks"&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Pulsars observed by radio and X-ray astronomers&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scientists have learned some basic facts about time as a dimension:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Some clocks are better than others&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;All clocks can be synchronized, to the limits of their accuracy&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Psychological or subjective time, as we experience it, has some odd effects – stress, age (but these are&amp;nbsp;not our focus here)&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Various effects are observed thanks to Einstein’s relativity theories, and the finite speed of light&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once we have accounted for all the objective effects, we find we can correct our measurements from one frame of reference to another, or from one observer to another, without any contradictions. So the picture holds.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, this vision of time does not capture every important aspect of our idea of time. We also need a completely different, second vision:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 style="text-align: center; "&gt;&lt;img alt="Two paths diverge in a wood" src="/_legacy/astro140/paths_in_wood.jpg" style="width: 400px; height: 190px;"&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;2. Time is Change&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the second vision, time is the relentless process of change in our cosmos that transforms the unknown future into the unchanging past. There are many differences between the past and the future - not just subjectively! Even with respect to strictly physical measurements, time has a "direction" to it that space (out in outer space, that is) does not. For example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;We remember the past and don’t know the future&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Complex systems evolve toward states of greater disorder, as codified in the famous&amp;nbsp;Second Law of Thermodynamics: Entropy of closed systems (including the universe as a whole) is always increasing&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Life's metabolic processes are&amp;nbsp;thermodynamic processes:&amp;nbsp;As pointed out by Schroedinger in our reading last week, life persists by eating "negative entropy" or order -&amp;nbsp;in the form of food -&amp;nbsp;from its surroundings, using it to increase and maintain internal order,&amp;nbsp;and releasing entropy or disorder -&amp;nbsp;in the form of heat and waste products - back to the outside world.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;All of our civilization's industrial processes also operate on this basis, taking in low-entropy fuel, "burning" or consuming it to carry out useful work, and&amp;nbsp;releasing heat and high-entropy waste as a result.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Similarly, any&amp;nbsp;process of recording data or making memories - creating a little bit of order in the universe - requires the disposal of "waste entropy" somewhere else.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The directionality of time is often pictured as an “Arrow of Time” pointing away from the past, toward the future. (Sometimes, different arrows of time are discussed, but in the end, these all amount to different versions of the Second Law of Thermodynamics.) From an ordinary, everyday point of view, there is nothing strange about this.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;However, from the point of view of time as a dimension (Vision #1), the difference between past and future is a very odd one indeed. The&amp;nbsp;"directionality" of time is simply not something that physical dimensions intrinsically possess. Out in space there is no difference between&amp;nbsp;left and right, forward and backward, or up and down. Similarly, elementary particle interactions do not recognize any distinction between the two directions of time; the underlying physical laws that govern their motions do not care whether we run our clocks forward or in reverse. So where does the arrow of time come from?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;The answer, it turns out, comes down to an aphorism of the Nobel laureate Philip Anderson, "More is Different."&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;h3 style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; text-align: center; "&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/_legacy/astro140/steamengine.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: 324px;"&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;h2&gt;Reconciling the Two Visions of Time&lt;/h2&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;The conflict between the two visions of time, one imagining a clockwork (backwards and forwards!) universe, and the other grappling with the messy developing reality of steam engines, friction, and metabolic processes,&amp;nbsp;came to a head in the latter half of the 19th century. Happily for a civilization that was beginning to feel a bit embarrassed about the conflict between its physical theories and its increasingly important industrial processes, these two competing visions were eventually reconciled. The work began with a group of theorists who developed statistical models for the behavior of systems with large numbers of particles, a mole (6.2 x 10&lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt;) or more, and reached its conclusion in the work of Austrian theorist Ludwig Boltzmann (1844-1906), who successfully connected this new science of &lt;em&gt;statistical mechanics&lt;/em&gt; to the laws of thermodynamics that were already known, including the second law. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p style="text-align: center; "&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/_legacy/astro140/boltzmann_tomb.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: 356px;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;What Boltzmann found was that the complexity of the system under study - the number of interacting particles - makes all the difference between a clockwork, reversible system and the messy world of ever-increasing entropy that we live in. Specifically, the seemingly irreversible nature of complex systems results from nothing more or less than the very large number of interacting particles that they contain, and the extreme improbability of them "accidentally" organizing themselves in any particular way without the action of outside forces. Consider: a single hydrogen atom (proton + electron) will easily ionize (break apart) or recombine (come back together); it may even switch back and forth between these two states a million times a second. A single egg, however (~10&lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt; particles), while it will readily break apart, will not so readily be put back together again. As Boltzmann showed, the contrast in behavior between the two systems - the contrast between our two visions of time - springs solely from the large number of particles involved in the egg, by comparison to the atom. His conclusions:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;ul&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;No "Arrow of Time" exists&amp;nbsp;for simple systems, nor for complex systems once they reach equilibrium.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;The Second Law of Thermodynamics is a&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;probabilistic&lt;/em&gt; law: Entropy can decrease&amp;nbsp;(eggs unscramble!)&amp;nbsp;even for complex&amp;nbsp;systems,&amp;nbsp;just with extreme, extreme&amp;nbsp;rarity (in the case of the egg,&amp;nbsp;only after many lifetimes of the universe).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Complex&amp;nbsp;systems put in a low-entropy initial state&amp;nbsp;exhibit an "Arrow of Time" as they&amp;nbsp;evolve, in highly predictable fashion,&amp;nbsp;to higher entropy states and eventually&amp;nbsp;equilibrium (maximum entropy).&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Since the universe around us exhibits an "Arrow of Time", we observe it in exactly this phase of its evolution.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;This rather unusual state of the universe can be understood if its entropy was very low in the distant past.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;/ul&gt;

	&lt;p style="text-align: center; "&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/_legacy/astro140/cmb_wmap.jpg" style="width: 400px; height: 293px;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;The last conjecture, known as Boltzmann’s “Past Hypothesis,” has been validated with superb precision by astronomers' studies of the cosmic microwave background radiation. This radiation provides us with a picture of the infant universe as it existed at 380,000 years of age, 99.997% of the way back to the Big Bang, and it shows a universe of extreme smoothness, and incredibly small entropy - much smaller than its entropy today, and even smaller than its maximum equilibrium entropy will be in the distant future.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;h3 style="text-align: center; "&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/_legacy/astro140/timehands.jpg" style="cursor: default; width: 300px; height: 226px;"&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;h3&gt;Time, Entropy, and Life in the Universe&lt;/h3&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;Since life can only persist in regions of space, and during times, where it is able to extract order from its surroundings (Schroedinger's definition, from last week), all life owes its existence to the extremely low-entropy state that our universe exhibited at its creation.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;Recalling that low-entropy states are low-probability states, this means that our universe was for some reason created in an extremely, extremely improbable state. To theorists today, this is one of the great outstanding puzzles about the origins of the universe. In the next set of notes we will discuss the only approach that has been able to make progress on this fundamental question....&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>A Modern View</title>
    <body>&lt;h2&gt;The Anthropic Principle&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For decades now, astrophysicists and physicists have been developing arguments about how the observed conditions of the physical Universe seem to be closely linked, in some particular ways, to the existence of living organisms such as ourselves. As we saw in the last page of notes on the nature of time, one of these arguments points out the extreme improbability of our universe's origin in its observed very low-entropy state. Separately, physicists have pointed out that the sizes, masses, and ages of objects we see (atoms, living organisms, planets, stars, galaxies, Universe) can all be derived, in an approximate fashion, by knowing the values of a few physical constants: the relative strengths of the gravitational, electrical, atomic, and nuclear forces; the relative masses of protons and electrons; and the key cosmological parameters of our universe. The existence of these objects thus places constraints on these elementary physical constants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The possibility of life as we know it evolving in the Universe depends on the values of a few basic physical constants -- and is in some respects remarkably sensitive to their numerical values."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Carr &amp; Rees, 1979)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, the existence of life on rocky (silicate) water-bearing planets like Earth requires that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The universal expansion following the Big Bang is tuned to produce long-lived, gravitationally-collapsed structures.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The ratio of light to particles in the Universe is sufficiently low to permit particles to form neutral atoms and permit gravitational collapse of stars.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The constants of nuclear physics are tuned to give long-lived main sequence phases of stars and red giants that synthesize heavy elements.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Together, such requirements place stringent constraints on the fundamental constants of nature, sometimes constraining them to with a few percent of their observed values. These arguments can be made in considerable detail. Here are some details:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;If the expansion after the Big Bang was weaker than we observe (with other cosmological conditions left the same), then the Universe would have expanded only briefly before recollapsing, and long-lived stars and the planets orbiting them would not have had time to exist. On the other hand, if the Big Bang had been significantly stronger than it was, particles would have&amp;nbsp;dispersed too far from one another too quickly for&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;gravity to&amp;nbsp;collect them into galaxies and stars. The "just right" early expansion that we observe&amp;nbsp;requires a delicate balance between the effects of&amp;nbsp;Dark Matter and Dark Energy.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;If the nuclear isotope of lithium &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;Li were stable, then the fusion of 4 &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H --&gt; 4He would proceed directly and quickly in the cores of stars, and the main sequence phase would not last billions of years.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;If the carbon nucleus &lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;C had an energy state just below -- instead of just above -- the energy of a beryllium &lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;Be energy state, then red giant nucleosynthesis would end at beryllium and heavier elements such as carbon or oxygen - necessary for life as we know it - would be extremely rare.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;If Newton's law of gravity were F = GMm/r&lt;sup&gt;2.1&lt;/sup&gt; rather than GMm/r&lt;sup&gt;2.0&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;(or any exponent other than exactly 2!),&amp;nbsp;then there would be no stable orbits for&amp;nbsp;planets around a star.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These arguments are known collectively as the Anthropic Principle. Several variations are discussed (weak Anthropic Principle, strong Anthropic Principle, final Anthropic Principle, etc). Many scientists dislike these arguments intensely: they seem post hoc, that is, positing that the observed phenomena of the universe somehow "act backward in time" on its past conditions. How could the existence of humans 13 billion years after the formation of the Universe possibly affect the properties it had when it was formed?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this is not actually what adherents of the Anthropic Principle propose. Rather, they suggest that we admit the possibility of there being many universes, each with different physical properties. Then, among the many universes of this "multiverse", life would exist only in those with the appropriate conditions; most probably, the vast majority of universes would not have any living inhabitants. This Multiverse or "Many Universes" Hypothesis is now considered seriously by theoretical physicists engaged in developing the latest theories of quantum relativity and inflationary cosmology. Perhaps universes emerge from some quantum foam? Perhaps the transition from inflation to ordinary expansion occurs differently in each region where it occurs, producing distinct Big Bangs (one per universe) with different properties? Perhaps there `are' (in some sense of existence) many Universes within which only a very few have the carefully tuned conditions necessary for life. Of course, if this is the case, it would not be surprising for us to find ourselves living in one of these rare Universes - just as it is not surprising that we find ourselves inhabiting a warm, stable world orbiting a single, steadily-burning star. In both cases, the "special" properties of our surroundings are in fact those that make our very existence possible.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Searching for Extraterrestrial Life</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;If other intelligences exist in the Galaxy, how do we best communicate with them?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hard X-rays/gamma-ray&lt;/b&gt;s: Hard to produce, impossible to focus&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ultraviolet/soft X-rays&lt;/b&gt;: Absorbed by atoms in interstellar gas (and Earth's atmosphere)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Optical&lt;/b&gt;: Signals overwhelmed by starlight&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Infrared/millimeter&lt;/b&gt;: Overwhelmed by interstellar &amp; interplanetary dust emission (and Earth's atmosphere)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Centimeter-wavelength (1-30 GHz) radio&lt;/b&gt;: YES!&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Longer than meter wavelength&lt;/b&gt;: Overwhelmed by interstellar electron synchrotron emission&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Non-electromagnetic radiation&lt;/b&gt;: neutrino beams? neutron beams? other subatomic particles? Technologies ineffective or not available.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Large radio telescopes sensitive to centimeter wavelength light are easily constructed (e.g. Arecibo Telescope in Puerto Rico, Very Large Array in New Mexico - photos below), radio waves are easily focused (paraboloid shaped dishes), radio receivers are extremely sensitive for reception, and radio broadcasting is easy (e.g. TV stations, radar at airports). Existing radio telescopes could easily detect a typical terrestrial radio/TV broadcast across the Galaxy -- if it were beamed directly towards us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="/_legacy/astro140/arecibo1.jpg" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img alt="The Arecibo single-dish radio telescope in Puerto Rico " class="lightbox" src="/_legacy/astro140/arecibo1.jpg" style="width: 38%;"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="/_legacy/astro140/vla.jpg" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img alt="The Jansky Very Large Array interferometer in New Mexico" class="lightbox" src="/_legacy/astro140/vla.jpg" style="width: 53%;"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What Frequency to Use?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Examples: AM band from 0.5-1.6 MHz; FM from 88-108 MHz; TV scattered from 50-1000 MHz, plus police/taxi radios, airport/military radar, long-distance telephone, satellite communications, cellphones (rapidly growing), etc. Only a few narrow bands are kept quiet for radio astronomy.&amp;nbsp; Arguments have been made that the best frequency to use is around 1420 MHz (21.1 cm), the emission line of cold hydrogen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Solution: build receivers that analyze signals from many (million, billion!) channels simultaneously within radio astronomical bands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;How Do We Recognize an Alien Signal?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Criteria might include: narrow band signal at wavelength not produced by atoms &amp; molecules; rapid variations in signal intensity (a message!) but not a radio pulsar; signal seen from star with good lifezone for habitable planets: signal seen in different telescopes (not local interference); periodic intensity or Doppler shifts from from their planet's rotation/orbit; signal contains complex information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Could Earth be Detected by Other Civilizations?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Major emission in centimeter band are military radar (esp. over Alaska and Siberia) and TV stations (esp. over US and Europe). Arecibo Telescope could detect these signals out to a few parsecs (tens of stars). TV broadcasts from 1978 had ~10 million watts power, and are now 20 lightyears (6 pc) away with ~20 A-G-K main sequence stars. So not much chance we have been detected yet.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>SETI Radio Searches</title>
    <body>&lt;h2&gt;Project Phoenix&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 1000 solar-like stars within 50 pc have been targeted with Parkes (Australia) 210-foot, Green Bank (West Virginia) 140-foot, and Arecibo (Puerto Rico) 1000-meter telescopes during the 1990s. ~50 million channels at 1-2 Hz resolution between 1-3 GHz (30-10 cm wavelength) are examined for continuous and pulsed signals, including frequency drifts.&amp;nbsp; Stars with newly discovered planets are included in search. Private funding because Federal funding turned off in 1993 by Congress.&amp;nbsp; Confirmation by an independent observatory required for identifying a candidate extreterrestrial signal.&amp;nbsp; Main technical challenge: elimination of human radio interference.&amp;nbsp; The image below shows frequency (horizontal axis) vs. time (vertical axis) brightness plot with an example of interference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="/_legacy/astro140/phoenix-4.gif" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img alt="Time-frequency plot of real radio data showing man-made interference" class="lightbox" src="/_legacy/astro140/phoenix-4.gif" style="width: 400px; height: 301px;"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Excerpt from the &lt;a href="https://www.seti.org/seti-institute/project/details/project-phoenix"&gt;Project Phoenix &lt;/a&gt;diaries, March 21 2002 at Arecibo (by Seth Shostak, SETI Institute):&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-left: 40px; "&gt;Jane Jordan and I tried not to get too excited. A signal picked up while observing target 4505, a star very slightly dimmer than the Sun that's 117 light-years away, was persistent and passing all the usual tests. We moved the telescope off the star system, and the signal went away. We ran it back on the target, and the signal reappeared. It was looking good. We continued to examine 4505 until the Earth's rotation took it beyond Arecibo's field of view, and it looked good all the while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-left: 40px; "&gt;Nonetheless, we've developed a certain&amp;nbsp; resistance to easy adrenaline rushes. The microwave band is increasingly jammed by interference from orbiting satellites, so false alarms are common.&amp;nbsp; As target 4505 drifted out of sight to the west, I wrote in the log book "should be&amp;nbsp; re-observed." The next night, we did exactly that. This time the signal was seen not only in the direction of the star, but in other directions as well. Sadly, it was just more earthly interference, and definitely not extraterrestrial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-left: 40px; "&gt;One of these days, this small scenario may end differently. And occasionally we think about that.&amp;nbsp; It's after midnight. Jill Tarter has taken over the observing, so I walk outside the control room to the patio that overlooks the telescope. Overhead, the familiar&amp;nbsp; winter constellations prick the humid air. Is there more out there than simply the&amp;nbsp; frigid blackness of space and the silent boiling of the stars? Are there hidden places where the sounds of life are being made and heard? Do beings exist that&amp;nbsp; can see the universe and understand what they see? It seems impossible to imagine otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Allen Telescope Array&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initially funded by Paul Allen, co-founder of Microsoft Corp, the &lt;a href="https://www.seti.org/ata"&gt;Allen Telescope Array&lt;/a&gt; of small antennas is being constructed in northern California for full-time SETI search.&amp;nbsp; This will increase SETI studies by a factor of ~100 over current levels, observing 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;-10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; stars and survey 4x10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; stars in the inner Milky Way at 1420 MHz.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ATA is a centimeter-wave array that pioneers the Large-Number Small-Diameter (LNSD) concept of building radio telescopes. By taking advantage of Moore’s Law, the designers are replacing steel with silicon, resulting in a large cost saving over telescopes of more conventional design. &amp;nbsp;If completed, the ATA will ultimately comprise 350 6-meter dishes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ATA has four primary advantages for scientific studies over all major radio telescopes built to date: a very wide field-of-view (2.45° at λ = 21cm), complete instantaneous frequency coverage from 0.5 to 11.2 GHz, multiple simultaneous backends, and active interference mitigation. The instantaneous area of sky imaged is 17 times that of the VLA. The instantaneous frequency coverage of more than 4 octaves is unprecedented in radio astronomy. &amp;nbsp;Unfortunately, the ATA has run out of money and is not continuously observing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 style="text-align: center; "&gt;Result from SETI observations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center; "&gt;NO EXTRATERRESTRIAL SIGNALS DETECTED&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center; "&gt;Not a single convincing alien signal has emerged from &lt;em&gt;ANY&lt;/em&gt; SETI observation to date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.seti.org"&gt;SETI Institute&lt;/a&gt; in California is run by Dr. Jill Tarter (who was the model for the heroine of the 1997 movie &lt;i&gt;Contact. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;Browse their &lt;a href="http://www.seti.org"&gt;Web site&lt;/a&gt; for interesting material regarding SETI. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</body>

    <title>Interstellar Travel &amp;amp; UFOs</title>
    <body>&lt;h2&gt;Why Interstellar Space Travel is Hard&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have chosen here to concentrate on a single spacecraft propulsion method here (matter-antimatter annihilation engines) and to think about the issue using elementary formulae from physics: &amp;nbsp;t=d/v (time to travel = distance divided by velocity); a=v/t (acceleration is change in velocity over time); KE = 1/2 mv&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (kinetic energy of a moving body is one-half the product of its mass and velocity squared); &amp;nbsp;E=mc&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (Albert Einstein's conversion between mass and energy, only achievable at extremely high temperatures or involving subatomic particles), and the `rocket equation' (not given here becuase it's a bit more complicated, but shows that it becomes exponentially more difficult to propel a spaceship when its mass is dominated by fuel).&amp;nbsp; Please look at a more thorough discussion of &lt;a href="/_legacy/astro140/interstellar_travel_crawford_1990.pdf"&gt;interstellar travel from this perspective by the Australian astrophysicist I.A. Crawford&lt;/a&gt; (Quar. J. Royal Astro. Soc. 31, 377-400, 1990), but you are not responsible for understanding this entire article.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recall from the Drake equation discussion that the distance to the nearest civilization or habitable planet is&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;d = (2x10&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;/N)&lt;sup&gt;1/3&lt;/sup&gt; parsecs,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;where N is the number of civilizations or habitable planets in the Galaxy.&amp;nbsp; Let's assume N~10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;, which gives d = 300 parsecs ~ 1000 lightyears ~ 1x10&lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt; meters. [Exoplanetary research indicates that the number of Earth-like Habitable Planets is higher than this, but the Drake equation suggests number of current Intelligent Civilizations is lower than this; so N~10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; seems like a reasonable middle ground.] &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our current spacecraft (e.g. Space Shuttle, probes to Jupiter and Saturn) travel at a speed around v = 10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; m/s, so the travel time would be&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;t = d/v = 1x10&lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt; m / 10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; m/s = 1x10&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt; sec ~ 30 million years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is far too long to be convenient for human beings! The obvious solution is to develop rocket propulsions that give faster speeds, say 10% of the speed of light: &amp;nbsp;v = 0.1 c = 3x10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; m/s.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Now the travel time would be&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;t = 1x10&lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt; m / 3x10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; m/s = 3x10&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt; s = 10 thousand years,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;which is still very long but not inconceivable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's check whether the human body can tolerate the acceleration and deceleration up to these speeds.&amp;nbsp; A spacecraft acceleration equivalent to the gravitational acceleration we feel on Earth's surface would be a ~ v/t ~ 10 m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&amp;nbsp; To reach a speed of v=0.1c would take&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;t ~ v / a = 3x10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; m/s / 10 m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 1 month,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;which is no problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now let's check the power requirements.&amp;nbsp; Assume the spacecraft has a mass of 100 tons, equivalent to a dozen trucks.&amp;nbsp; Its kinetic energy is&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;E = 1/2 m v&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 1/2 (1x10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; kg) (3x10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; m/s)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 5x10&lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt; watt-sec.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The engine power must thus be at least&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;E / t = 5x10&lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt; watt-s / 3x10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; s ~ 2000 megawatts,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;comparable to big modern power stations. (Here I've assumed acceleration for 1/10th of the 10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; year trip.) This doesn't seem too difficult.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But how do we produce so much power for 10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; years from such a small mass? The most efficient source of energy is to tap Einstein's equivalence of mass and energy, E=mc&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&amp;nbsp; We need&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;m = E / c&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; ~ 5x10&lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt; watt-s / (3x10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; m/s)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 500 kg,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;which is within our mass limit.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the only efficient way we know to derive this energy is from the annihilation of matter and anti-matter, and we have not been able to make and transport more than infinitisimal (&lt;&lt;&lt;1 gm) quantities of anti-matter. Fermilab's Main Injector can accumulate ~10&lt;sup&gt;-8&lt;/sup&gt; g of antiprotons/year. If Fermilab uses ~10&lt;sup&gt;-4&lt;/sup&gt; of modern society's energy resources for 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; years to fuel our spaceship. This is reduced to ~10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; years if one could tap all of the solar energy incident on the Earth's surface, and less if one could build a Ringworld or a Dyson sphere to trap a greater fraction of their Sun's energy output. The antiprotons produced must then be cooled with electrons in magnetic traps and (perhaps) stored as solid antihydrogen until needed for flight propulsion. See the analysis &lt;a href="http://www.engr.psu.edu/antimatter/Papers/anti_prod.pdf"&gt;Production and trapping of antimatter for space propulsion applications&lt;/a&gt; by (former-PSU Physics professor) G. A. Smith &amp; colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Crawford makes a similar (but better!) calculation of a spaceship using antimatter drives in his section 4. &amp;nbsp;Note that I ignored the question of how to actually produce thrust from matter-antimatter annihilation; Crawford argues that the annihilating particles should be surrounded by ordinary matter (say, water that Crawford calls the `reaction fluid') that absorbs the products (pions, muons and positrons) of the annihilations, heats and evaporates (makes steam) &amp;nbsp;giving a jet of ordinary atoms to thrust the spaceship forward. &amp;nbsp;Now the spaceship weighs more (carrying tons of reaction fluid), so more than a few hundred kilograms of antimatter is needed to power the trip. &amp;nbsp;Crawford solves the rocket equation (eq. 1-9). &amp;nbsp;Crawford and others don't think the antimatter drive is feasible because we can't make enough antimatter, and they prefer light sail technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;Conclusion: &lt;/b&gt;The distances between existing intelligent civilizations is likely to be &gt;1000 light years, although the distance to the nearest Earth-like Habitable Planet might be as little as ~10-100 lightyears.&amp;nbsp; It is physically possible for a civilization&amp;nbsp; to travel such distances if the travel time is long (say 10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;yrs).&amp;nbsp; But it is very difficult (orders of magnitude byond our current societal capability) to produce the necessary antimatter fuel, or the necessary laser power for light sails. As such, designing a space ship that can reach other stars in a human lifetime is not possible for our society at present, but it is also not ruled out by any laws of physics.&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Drake Equation</title>
    <body>&lt;h2&gt;How Many Intelligent Civilizations are in the Galaxy Today?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1961, astronomer Frank Drake developed a formula to estimate the number of intelligent species or communicable civilizations in our galaxy that we could communicate with at this instant of time. The &lt;b&gt;Drake Equation&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;is still used to estimate the number of cummunicable civilizations in the Galaxy. Reasonable estimates range from 1 (only us) to 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;i&amp;nbsp;&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;= N&lt;sub&gt;*&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;x f&lt;sub&gt;p&amp;nbsp;&lt;/sub&gt;x N&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;x f&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;x f&lt;sub&gt;l&amp;nbsp;&lt;/sub&gt;x f&lt;sub&gt;i&amp;nbsp;&lt;/sub&gt;x L&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;/L&lt;sub&gt;MW&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Values need to be determined for each factor. Some can be calculated fairly easily, other are extremely uncertain estimates. A wide range of information is needed to determine &lt;strong&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. &amp;nbsp;Note that this is not a real equatlion of physics, like Newton's equations of motion and gravity. &amp;nbsp;Rather, it is a way to organize ones thinking about life in the Universe. &amp;nbsp;Different calculations can have slightly different factors. &amp;nbsp;Let us now go through these factors individually, and then multiply them to ogether to estimate the number of intelligent civilizations in the Galaxy today.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;N* = Number of stars in the galaxy. &lt;/strong&gt; Current measurement of the size, rotation and luminosity of our Milky Way Galaxy gives a mass in stars (excluding the Galaxy's Dark Matter) around 300 billion M&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; (3 x 10&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt; solar masses). Since the most common star has M~0.3 M&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;, we estimate there are a trillion (1 x 10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;) stars in the Milky Way.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;fp&amp;nbsp;= Fraction of these stars that can host habitable planets.&lt;/strong&gt; High mass stars (OBAF) may evolve so fast that intelligent life does not have the time to develop; but these stars are rare. &amp;nbsp;Binary systems with 0.1-100AU separations will not permit stable orbits; this eliminates some stars. &amp;nbsp;But the very recent census of exoplanets, discussed two weeks ago, directly demonstrates that the majority of stars -- not only can -- but actually do contain planets that orbit inside, within, and outside the habitable zone. &amp;nbsp;So, I think that a&amp;nbsp;reasonable estimate today is fp~0.7&amp;nbsp;-- very high compared to earlier discussions of the Drake Equation. &amp;nbsp;(The current authors of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_equation"&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;, for example, are more cautious but still put this at fraction at 0.2-0.5.) &amp;nbsp;Until recently, many astronomers considered this fraction to be lower (maybe 0.05), but it has recently be recognized that the very common&amp;nbsp;low-mass M stars have good Habitable Zones close to the star. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;= number of planets per star &lt;/strong&gt;. Our own solar system has ~8 planets. &amp;nbsp;Using radial velocity techniques,&amp;nbsp;Penn State Professor Jason Wright has estimated that at least 28% of stars that have one planet also have additional planets. &amp;nbsp;See his &lt;a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2009ApJ...693.1084W"&gt;2009 paper&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Using planetary transit techniques, the Kepler mission has found roughly 10% of stars with one planet also have additional planets. &amp;nbsp;But in both cases other planets could be present and still be undetected today. &amp;nbsp;Planet formation calculations (e.g. oligarchic growth of planetary embryos) suggest that a number of widely-spaced planets is a common and stable configuration. &amp;nbsp;My estimate, based on the data and planet formation&amp;nbsp;theory&amp;nbsp;is again optimistic:&amp;nbsp; N&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;~5.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;f&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;= Fraction of these planets with Earth-like conditions suitable for life.&lt;/strong&gt; This restricts planets of interest to those with nearly-circular orbits in the habitable zone where water is liquid. &amp;nbsp;Planetary mass and atmospheric composition play an important role in habitability, e.g. through the carbonate-silicate cycle (Scharf's text, sec 9.3).&amp;nbsp; In our own system, 1-2 out of 8 planets are suitable for life for extended periods (say, &gt;1 Gyr, Gyr = giga year = billion years). &amp;nbsp;this includes Earth and Mars, because Mars was habitable 1-2 GYy ago when water flowed in rivers and oceans.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;A few of the extrasolar planets fall within the Habitable Zone, though often with eccentric orbits. &amp;nbsp;The recent estimates based on Kepler mission data by &lt;a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1103.1443"&gt;Catanzarite &amp; Shao&lt;/a&gt; and by &lt;a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1109.4682"&gt;Traub&lt;/a&gt; suggest&amp;nbsp;f&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;~0.03-0.3. &amp;nbsp;Again this is a very high fraction. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;f&lt;sub&gt;l&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;= Fraction of suitable planets where life actually develops &lt;/strong&gt; Miller-Urey experiments show&amp;nbsp; that biotic material (e.g.. amino acids, lipids) can arise in an environment like the early Earth. &amp;nbsp;Simple biotic material may also be brought in by infalling interstellar particles or comets. Life may take a wide variety of forms from sulfur metabolizing, deep-sea vent bacteria to oxygen-breathing animals. &amp;nbsp;Nonetheless, there has been no success in producing self-reproducing macromolecular systems in the laboratory. So the mechanism of life formation is still unknown and the probability of it happening in a limited time or location is very small. &amp;nbsp;The integrated probability over a Gyr and over an entire planet is unknown. &amp;nbsp;Let's say the chance is at least one-in-a-thousand habitable planets give rise to life,&amp;nbsp;f&lt;sub&gt;l&lt;/sub&gt;~10&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt;-10&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;f&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;= Our definition of an intelligent civilization is one that is able to communicate using radio telescopes.&lt;/strong&gt; It took ~4 Gyr for simple cyanobacteria to evolve into radio astronomers.&amp;nbsp; Asteroidal impacts (such as the one that killed the dinosaurs) or climatic changes (like the changes that dried up Mars) are two possibilities. It is also possible that an intelligent species might emerge but be unable or unwilling to communicate, e.g.&amp;nbsp; life on water or gas worlds. &amp;nbsp;This quantity is entirely unknown. &amp;nbsp;Let's say again at least on-in-a-thousand but no more than 10% of lifeforms develop radio telescopes: &amp;nbsp;f&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;=10&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt;-10&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;L/L&lt;sub&gt;MW&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;= Lifetime of communicating civilization / Lifetime of Milky Way.&lt;/strong&gt; The lifetime of the Milky Way is ~11 Gyr (1x10&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;yr). Our radio telescopes have been in existence only tens-of-years (10&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;yr)&amp;nbsp;and all human culture with written languages are 10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;yr old. &amp;nbsp;What does the future hold? &amp;nbsp;Civilizations can be destroyed by nuclear or biological war, environmental or technological disaster, &amp;nbsp;asteroidal impact or some other catastrophe. It is also possible that civilizations have the ability to build radio telescope, but choose not to. &amp;nbsp;Let's guess L/L&lt;sub&gt;MW&lt;/sub&gt;~10&lt;sup&gt;-7&lt;/sup&gt;-10&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;center&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;i&amp;nbsp;&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;= (1x10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;*&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;x 0.7&lt;sub&gt;p&amp;nbsp;&lt;/sub&gt;x 5&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;x (0.03-0.3)&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;x (10&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt;-10&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;l&amp;nbsp;&lt;/sub&gt;x (10&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt;-10&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;)&amp;nbsp;&lt;sub&gt;i&amp;nbsp;&lt;/sub&gt;x (10&lt;sup&gt;-7&lt;/sup&gt;-10&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt;) &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Multiplying these factors give a range of to 1x10&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;to 1x10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;intelligent civilizations in the Galaxy today.&amp;nbsp;The minimum of 3x10&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;intelligent civilizations in the Galaxy today seems too low. &amp;nbsp;Since we have radio telescopes, the number is at least 1 = 10&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So it is reasonable to consider that there are between one (we are alone in the Galaxy) to a hundred million (10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;) intelligent civilizations in the Galaxy today. &amp;nbsp;For convenience, let us choose &lt;strong&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;~10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, understanding that it could be a thousand times higher or lower. Most of the uncertainty involves the biological and sociological aspects of the Drake Equation (last three factors), not the astronomical aspects (first four aspects). &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Please examine similar discussions of the Drake Equation online&amp;nbsp;at &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_equation"&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.seti.org/drakeequation" style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; "&gt;the SETI Institute website&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;nbsp;This last link, to the SETI Institute in California, has a great 7-minute TED talk by Jill Tarter, Director of the Institute who was the model for the heroine of the 1997 movie &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contact_(film)"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Contact&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (written by Carl Sagan). &amp;nbsp;She emphasizes the importance of the L/L&lt;sub&gt;MW&lt;/sub&gt; factor in the Drake Equation. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;How Far Away is the Nearest Intelligent Civilization?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can use our answer to estimate if communication with other intelligent civilizations is practical by asking: What is the average distance between civilizations for a given N&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;? &amp;nbsp;Consider that most stars lie in the Galactic disk (the Galactic halo has fewer stars and these have lower metallicities, so plausibly fewer planets). The Milky Way disk is roughly a cylinder with volume:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;2 pi R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; x h ~ 2 pi (100,000 ly)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; 1,500 ly ~&amp;nbsp; 1 x 10&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;ly&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; (cubic light years)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p style="text-align: left; "&gt;The density of civilizations is the number per unit volume, or &lt;strong&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; / (1 X 10&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;) civilizations per cubic light year. &amp;nbsp;Since volumes have units of (distance)&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, and the density has units of (distance)&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt;, &amp;nbsp;the typical distance between civilizations (if they are randomly distributed in the Galactic disk) is d = 1/ (Density)&lt;sup&gt;1/3&lt;/sup&gt;. &amp;nbsp;So, if N&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;=10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;and Volume=10&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt; lightyears, the density is 10&lt;sup&gt;-11&lt;/sup&gt; ly&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt; and the average distance between civilizations is d ~ 5,000 ly. &amp;nbsp;This is about 2 kpc (kiloparsecs) using the units familiar to astronomers. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;For a more optimistic estimate of &lt;strong&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;=1,000,000, d ~ 500 ly = 200 pc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The distance in light years is the time it takes to send a message in years. Twice this number is the time to send a message and get a reply (plus a bit for the message recipient to think of a response and prepare the radio telescope).&amp;nbsp; &lt;strong&gt;So, for middle values of N&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; in the Drake Equation, a typical conversation takes thousands of years to occur. &lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;That's very long on himan timescales! &amp;nbsp;If the first pharaohs of ancient Egypt had our advanced telescope technology and sent a message to the nearest civilization (assuming they knew which star had the right inhabited planet with radio telescopes), we would only now be receiving the first response. Thus, except for very optimistic values of &lt;strong&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, optimistic values, meaningful conversations between civilizations are not really viable because the time to send/receive a message is longer than the duration of a civilization.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Interlude: Life and Climate</title>
    <body>&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="http://content.bitsontherun.com/players/HNyUHyXw-2pHRl6he.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As outlined in my video above, this week will have no lecture.&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="https://content.bitsontherun.com/players/HNyUHyXw-2pHRl6he.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As outlined in my video above, this week will have no lecture. &amp;nbsp;Rather the class will learn about, and through computer simulations, experience some scientific issues concerning possible effects of life forms on a planet's climate. &amp;nbsp;We will then discuss the issues with each other on a Discussion Forum on the ANGEL Web site. &amp;nbsp;(This is an asynchronous discussion: we can each login when convenient over the next week, and start new conversations or add to existing ones.) &amp;nbsp;You will be graded up to 5 points for your contributions to the ANGEL Discussion Forum. &amp;nbsp;Click on the "Syllabus" tab above to see the small alteration in the course grading (highlighted in yellow).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please do the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Read about the very recent findings that Arctic Ice cap is melting faster than previously seen. &amp;nbsp;This is yet another warning that global warming induced by releast of carbon dioxide (and other greenhouse gases) is causing rapid changes in our climate. &amp;nbsp;News articles on this finding can be found &lt;a href="https://www.commondreams.org/headline/2012/09/07-3"&gt; here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a&gt;, &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.opednews.com/populum/linkframerss.php?linkid=17643"&gt; here&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.npr.org/2012/09/24/161701420/as-arctic-ice-melts-so-does-the-snow-and-quickly"&gt; here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.news24.com/Columnists/AndreasSpath/Arctic-alarm-bells-20121008"&gt; here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Read about DaisyWorld, a simulation of hypothetical planets with life forms that reflect (white daisies) and absorb (black daisies) sunlight to different degrees. DaisyWorld is discussed in our textbook `Extrasolar Planets and Astrobiology' by Scharf in sec 6.8 (pp. 280-295). As before, we are not responsible for the equations. Online background on DaisyWorld can be found on &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daisyworld"&gt; Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;. Note the word `albedo' means `reflectivity': an object with albedo = 0 is black (fully absorbing of incident light) while an object with albedo = 1 is white (fully reflecting).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Play with interactive DaisyWorld simulations. &amp;nbsp;There are two we can try: &amp;nbsp;the &lt;a href="http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/models/Daisyworld"&gt; Northwestern University model&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="http://gingerbooth.com/flash/daisyball"&gt; DaisyBall model&lt;/a&gt;. In each case, read the introductory material &amp;nbsp;and click on the "Run" button. Start with some simple situations, such as all-white or all-black daisies. What happens? Then try a mixture of black and white daisies. Do you get an oscillating solution? Try to find a combination that gives a comfortably habitable planet; say temperatures in the range 10-30 degrees Centigrade. Is it easy to find one? Try other situations: a more or less luminous Sun, several daisy types, changing daisies, and so forth. Do you have any thoughts about the implications for advanced life forms on other planets?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Join the DaisyWorld Discussion Forum on our ANGEL Web page. &amp;nbsp;You should find it under the `Lessons' tab. &amp;nbsp;Start a new conversation, or join an old one. &amp;nbsp;Informed and substantive contributions to the Discussion Forum will earn the full 5 points to the grade. &amp;nbsp;Let us try to complete our Forum contributions by end-of-day Monday October 15. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    <title>Science Writing Papers</title>
    <body>&lt;h2&gt;Start Here&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://psu.voicethread.com/new/share/6110021/"&gt;Start with this 10-min video about science writing&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;(This video was made a previous semester, so the due dates are wrong. The correct deadlines&amp;nbsp;are given below.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="270" src="https://psu.voicethread.com/app/player/?threadId=6110021" width="480"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Goals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goals of the paper assignments are as follows: &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Provide students with the opportunity to investigate a narrow scientific issue in some detail;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Challenge the student to assimilate diverse information into a coherent narrative;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Provide training in the art of&amp;nbsp;scientific writing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Format&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The paper should be prepared with a word processing program like Microsoft Word or Google Docs, in the following format: 12pt Arial or Times Roman font; single-spaced, 1 inch margins; 8.5x11 inch or A4 paper. Papers may be submitted in either .docx or .pdf fomat with file names like "Lastname_Paper1.pdf". &amp;nbsp;For each paper, the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;text&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; length is between 2 and 3 pages (roughly 7-11 paragraphs) and 1-2 &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;additional pages&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; with references (minimum three non-encyclopedia references) and useful figures or tables (e.g., jpg images imported from Web resources). &amp;nbsp;A&amp;nbsp;cover sheet should be added with the paper title, student name and email, and date of submission. &amp;nbsp; The draft for paper #1 should be double-spaced (and hence will be 4-6 pages of text, plus references), so as to leave space for writing&amp;nbsp;comments. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Grading&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paper 1 will count 12% of the course grade, and Paper 2 will count 15%. &amp;nbsp;For Paper 1, students will submit a draft (a detailed outline with references would also be&amp;nbsp;acceptable) to the instructor for improvement of writing and organization, but the grade will be based on the final version. &amp;nbsp;Half of the grade will be based on content: motivation, scientific details, and synthesis. &amp;nbsp;Half of the grade will be based on writing:&amp;nbsp; overall organization, well-designed paragraphs, sentences and grammar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Deadlines&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paper 1 draft is due &lt;b&gt;Friday, September 32. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;The final version of&amp;nbsp;Paper 1 is due &lt;b&gt;Friday, October 14. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;Paper 2 is due by &lt;b&gt;Tuesday, December 13&lt;/b&gt; (near the beginning of Exam Week)&lt;b&gt;. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;Papers are to be submitted via Canvas. &amp;nbsp;[UPDATE WITH MORE DETAILED INSTRUCTIONS.] &amp;nbsp;Students are strongly encouraged to informally consult with the instructor as they progress with the papers. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Paper Topic&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For paper #1, paper topic should be chosen from the list below, or selected by mutual agreement with the instructor. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;Generally speaking, your textbook and Wikipedia provide useful starting points for your research; however, they may not be your primary sources. &amp;nbsp; Consultation of a minimum of three additional high-quality resources is required. If you have difficulty identifying resources, please contact the instructor. &amp;nbsp;If you have trouble obtaining full text versions of important documents&amp;nbsp;for the course, then please ask Penn State libraries for assistance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Writing Style&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quality science writing is a skill well worth developing and exercising. The paper's overall organization looks like a U: it begins with a short statement of motivation or scientific issue; most of the text presents the evidence or argument (usually a combination of empirical findings and scientific model formulation); and the paper ends with a discussion of how the results relate to the original motivation. Within the text, the paragraphs should follow a logical trail. Within a paragraph, sentences should be well-constructed with informative nouns and verbs; use of the passive voice should be avoided as much as&amp;nbsp;practical. No first person language (use of "i" or "We") is permitted.&amp;nbsp; For useful advice, please see:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regarding references, the common procedure in the physical sciences literature is&amp;nbsp;to say in the text " ... blah blah (Smith 2010). &amp;nbsp;... blah blah (Smith &amp; Ford 2011) " and then in the references&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smith, A. B. 2010,&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;A big result on extremophiles&lt;/em&gt;,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.blah.org" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.blah.org&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;[or]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smith, A. B. &amp; Ford, E. B. 2011,&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;A big result on extremophiles&lt;/em&gt;, Astrophysical Journal, 409, 525-530&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Plagiarism is strictly prohibited.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; For example, you are not permitted to cut and paste text from the Web, rather than understanding and restating the issues in your own voice (with appropriate reference). &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Extensive quotations and quotations from any source are also inappropriate.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Note that it will be much easier to phase an argument or conclusion in your own words if you have reviewed multiple references on the subject before writing your own text. The presence of plagiarized text may be checked using specialized software. &amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Plagiarism can have severe consequences. &amp;nbsp;If you have any doubts about whether something might be considered plagiarism, ASK BEFORE, not after you submit the assignment.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OGLE-2006-BLG-109: A twin of our Solar System found with gravitational microlensing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HR 8799: Four planets found from direct imaging&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll try to add a few more possible topics as the semester progresses (based on the some&amp;nbsp;recent discoveries). &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Students are encouraged to identify a&amp;nbsp;topic for paper #2 that is of particular interest to them. &amp;nbsp;If you do so, you should consult with the instructor and make sure that your topic and proposed references are approved.&amp;nbsp;Please include Astro 140 in the subject line, a proposed title,&amp;nbsp;~3-4 sentance summary of the topic, and references/links to two to four scientific papers that would be important references for the paper. &amp;nbsp; It is important that students consult with the instructor&amp;nbsp;well in advance of the deadline, so that they can incorporated feedback from the instructor, (if necessary completely change topic), identify additional references, and then begin the research once the topic has been approved.&lt;/p&gt;
