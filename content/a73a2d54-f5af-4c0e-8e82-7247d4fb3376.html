<p><strong><em>This topic is briefly covered in section 6.6.1. &nbsp;Again, we don't need to know the mathematical details.</em></strong></p>
<p>When a planet orbits a star, the star orbits the planet! &nbsp;Or, as Isaac Newton showed in his masterful work on the dynamics (motions and forces) of massive objects, both the planet and the star orbit the `center of mass' of the system. &nbsp;Since the star is much more massive than the planet (our Sun is ~thousand times more massivethan Jupiter, and ~million time more than Earth), the star's motion is very small compared to the size of the planet's orbit.</p>

<div style="text-align: left; ">If several planets are present, then they each pull the star in different directions at different orbital periods, giving rise to a complicated wobble pattern that would tell a good deal about the planetary system. &nbsp;Here is how the Sun would look if its position could be accurately monitored&nbsp;from another star:</div>

<p>Learn more about the Sun's wobble with the interactive applet <a href="http://astro.unl.edu/classaction/animations/extrasolarplanets/ca_extrasolarplanets_starwobble.html" target="_blank">at the UNL's star wobble website</a>. What planets have the greatest dynamical effect on the Sun?</p>
<p>Unfortunately, a quantitative evaluation of this effect shows it is extremely small. &nbsp;If the Sun were viewed from a star 10 parcsec distant and that is a very close star), then the maximum wobble is only about 1/1000 of an arcsecond. &nbsp;Even the most accurate telescope available today cannot achieve this accuracy in the visible or infrared band. &nbsp;It is there not a surprise that no planets have yet been discovered due to the &nbsp;astrometric wobble of the host star.</p>
<div style="text-align: left; ">This situation is expected to change in a few years with the arrival of data from the&nbsp;"GAIA" mission led by the European Space Agency (ESA).&nbsp;From space, beyond the distorting effects of Earth's atmosphere, the mission will be able to measure the positions of 1 billion stars in our Galaxy to micro-arcsecond precision, far beyond the capabilities of the best ground-based observatories. It is expected that GAIA will thus detect many massive planets via the astrometric motions of their host stars; however, its precision is not sufficient to promise detection of Earth-like planets in the habitable zones of (most of) these stars.</div>
