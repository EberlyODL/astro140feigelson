<p><em>Here we will&nbsp;listen to a ~20 minute talk by Prof. Eric B. Ford from Penn State's Dept. of Astronomy & Astrophysics. &nbsp;This is the video he presents at this point in the Astro 140 curriculum. &nbsp;&nbsp;Eric is a prize-winning researcher in&nbsp;</em><i>exoplanetary astronomy, and he has an thoughtful and deeply informed analysis of what we can ... and can not ... expect to discover about life on exoplanets. &nbsp;I recommend that you first read our textbook's Chpt. 8 on 'How to find life on exoplanets', as it interweaves&nbsp;nicely with Eric's&nbsp;presentation.</i></p>
