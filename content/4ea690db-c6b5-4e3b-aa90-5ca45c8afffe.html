<p>Since the beginning of western culture, scholars have discussed the possibility that we are not alone in the Universe. For centuries, this was the domain of natural philosophers and theologians who discussed the issues based on abstract philosophical and religious ideas. Even astronomers who addressed the matter (e.g. Christiaan Huygens and William&nbsp;Herschel in the 18th century) engaged in fantastical thinking not supported by their observations. In modern times, the popularity of `science fiction' involving aliens from outer space reveals that the issue still has high cultural interest.</p>
<p>But, starting around the 1970s (e.g., Carl Sagan, Frank Drake, Lynn Margulis), these discussions began to be rooted in empirical findings of astronomy, planetary science, chemistry, and biology. It is not longer fantastic to discuss the possibility of extraterrestrial life. Our course will take this modern approach to the subject, but it is valuable to recognize the historical background. The information below is in outline form, but you are encouraged to learn more about these historical figures and ideas through the Web links.</p>
<h2>Greek/Roman Era (500BC - 400AD) Arguments Both Against and in Favor of Extraterrestrial Life</h2>
<ul><li style="text-align: left;">Plato & Aristotle's <a href="http://galileo.rice.edu/images/things/ptolematic_universe.gif" target="_blank">geocentric universe</a>: the celestial bodies are totally different from our earthly world
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;"><li style="text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.mountainman.com.au/aeon_faq.htm" target="_blank">Terrestrial material</a>: Earth, Water, Air, Fire</li><li style="text-align: left;">Heavenly material: quintessence or ether, crystalline spheres for Sun/planets/stars</li><li style="text-align: left;">In contrast, Democritus, Epicurus & Lucretius' s <a href="http://faculty.washington.edu/smcohen/320/atomism.htm" target="_blank">atomic universe</a>: many Suns/Earths possible</li></ul></li><li style="text-align: left;">Sun not Earth at center of solar system (Earth not special)</li><li style="text-align: left;">Myriad stars/Suns each with planets (Sun not special)&nbsp;</li></ul>

<h2 style="text-align: left;">Christian Era (500-1500) Strong Prohibition against Extraterrestrial Life</h2>
<ul><li style="text-align: left;">Aristotlean science incorporated into Christian theology (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamics_of_the_celestial_spheres" target="_blank">angels/seraphim ~ heavenly spheres</a>). E.g. in Dante's <a href="http://www.divinecomedy.org/divine_comedy.html" target="_blank">Divine Comedy</a>.</li><li style="text-align: left;">God created Heaven, Earth and & Man (<a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/1-1.htm" target="_blank">Book of Genesis</a>, ancient Hebrew creation story). Man lies between beasts and angels (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_chain_of_being" target="_blank">Chain of Being</a>). Life on Earth has unique relationship to God and cannot exist elsewhere.</li></ul>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">Age of Enlightment (1500-1900) Great Popularity of Extraterrestrial Life</h2>
<ul><li style="text-align: left;"><a href="http://galileo.rice.edu/bio/narrative_6.html" target="_blank">Galileo's telescope</a> (new moons/planets/stars), <a href="http://csep10.phys.utk.edu/astr161/lect/history/newton3laws.html" target="_blank">Newton's laws</a> imply that the mechanics of the celestial bodies (e.g. Moon (celestial mechanics) are not different from the mechanics of our terrestrial world.</li><li style="text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.webelements.com/" target="_blank">Chemical elements</a>, <a href="http://www.universetoday.com/53563/who-discovered-helium/" target="_blank">discovery of "atoms" on Earth and in stellar spectra</a></li><li style="text-align: left;">Plurality of worlds very popular. Scholars write about Venusians, Lunar Cities, Martian canals. Examples include: Bernard de Fontenelle's <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=VGoFAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA1&dq=Fontenelle+Bernard+inauthor:Fontenelle#v=onepage&q=Fontenelle%20Bernard%20inauthor%3AFontenelle&f=false" target="_blank">Conversations on the Plurality of Worlds</a> (1686, popular book among the nobles of France under Louis XIV) and Christiaan Huygens'&nbsp;Cosmotheoros&nbsp;(1698, book on human-like beings on Moon and the planets by a famous astronomer)</li></ul>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">Three Illustrative Quotes</h3>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: left;">"The Marchioness was very impatient to know what the fixed stars were. Are the inhabited, like the planets [in our Solar System]? said she, or are they not peopled. â€¦ The neighboring worlds sometimes send us visitors, who come, in a very magnificent style. These visitors are comets, ornamented with brilliant flowing hard, a venerable beard, or a majestic train" (<a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=VGoFAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA1&dq=Fontenelle+Bernard+inauthor:Fontenelle#v=onepage&q=Fontenelle%20Bernard%20inauthor%3AFontenelle&f=false" target="_blank">de Fontenelle 1686, p.110 & 121</a>)</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">"What a wonderful and amazing Scheme have we here of the magnificent Vastness of the Universe! So many Suns, so many Earths, and every one of them stockd with so many Herbs, Trees and Animals, and adornd with so many Seas and Mountains!" (Huygens 1698)</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">"... the knowledge of the construction of the Moon leads us insensibly to several consequences... such as the great probability, not to say almost absolute certainty, of her being inhabited." (William Herschel 1780, famous astronomer, discoverer of Uranus using Newton's laws)</p></blockquote>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">Modern Era (1900--) Arguments Both Against and in Favor of Extraterrestrial Life</h2>
<p>Skepticism about life outside Earth (review&nbsp;<a href="http://tal.forum2.org/rare" target="_blank">Rare Earth hypothesis</a>):</p>
<ul><li style="text-align: left;">Temperatures, atmospheres in most planets are inhospitable</li><li style="text-align: left;">Failure to make 'life in the test tube' or find life on Moon/Mars</li><li style="text-align: left;">Simple life (e.g. bacteria) may be common but complex life (e.g. humans) may be rare</li><li style="text-align: left;">No evidence for extraterrestrial life yet</li></ul>
<h3>Illustrative Quote</h3>
<blockquote><p>"... how totally unfitted are all the other planets [in our Solar System] either to develop or to preserve the higher forms of life, and in most cases, any above the lowest and most rudimentary. ... Mars receives less than half the amount of sun-heat per unit surface that we do. And as it is almost certain that it contains no water ... man's place in the solar system is altogether unique, and that no other planet either has developed or can develop such a full and complete life." (evolutionist A. R. Wallace, 1903)</p></blockquote>
