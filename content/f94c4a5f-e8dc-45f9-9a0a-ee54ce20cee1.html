<p>The possible existence of life beyond Earth is one of the most fundamental questions relating the human race to the physical Universe around us. While considerations of extraterrestrial life were in the domains of philosophy and science fiction in the past, today we have considerable scientific knowledge that can be applied to the question. Advances in modern astronomy have dramatically improved our understanding of our cosmic surroundings: tracing the cosmic origins of biological molecules, direct evidence for planets around most stars (exoplanets), and a deeper understanding of planet formation have all emerged in the past generation.&nbsp; Several fields -- geology, biochemistry, paleontology (fossils), evolutionary biology --&nbsp; give insight (though not a complete understanding) on how life arose on Earth, and spacecraft travel provides constraints on life elsewhere in our Solar System.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The results from studies on Earth, the Solar System, and exoplanets across the Galaxy together indicate that the conditions for life are widespread in the Universe; extraterrestrial life has not been found yet, but does not seem implausible. Interstellar space travel between habitable planets, by humans or other beings, is exceedingly difficult but not physically impossible.&nbsp;&nbsp; The course is thus rooted in modern science, but is connected to the long-standing philosophical question: Are we alone in the Universe? Today, this question is often embedded in science fiction (such as movies about aliens) and discussion about whether aliens have visited Earth.&nbsp; Today, astronomical studies are leading the way in answering part of the question:&nbsp; Earth-like planets seem&nbsp;to be extremely common.&nbsp; But there is no evidence yet for life beyond&nbsp;Earth. &nbsp;The course satisfies the General Natural Sciences (GN) component of the General Education requirements for a Bachelors degree from Penn State. &nbsp;It requires the student has prior experience with an introductory astronomy course, but a background with another science course (e.g. biology, geology, chemistry)&nbsp;at the university level may suffice. &nbsp;Students in this situation should contact the instructor during Drop/Add period to discuss whether the class is appropriate.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h2>What You Will Learn</h2>
<p>The course naturally will give the student opportunity to learn lots of exciting new scientific discoveries in astronomy with strong elements of chemistry, geology and biology. &nbsp;These findings are integrated around the basic question "Is there life in the Universe outside Earth?". &nbsp; In addition to acquisition of knowledge, the course will return several times to discuss how science progresses, what science can tell us, and how it relates to other forms of thinking. &nbsp;Finally, the course seeks to teach an important skill called `science writing'. &nbsp;Here the student gathers information from diverse scientific sources and writes informative, well-organized, and well-phrased essays in a formal style that deemphasizes personal opinion and includes citations to scientific literature. &nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Course Objectives</strong></h2>
<p>The course objectives for students to achieve during the semester are:</p>
<ul><li><p><em>Knowledge & Comprehension:</em> Define vocabulary. List facts and observational data that enable you to participate in scientific discussions regarding the potential for life beyond Earth. &nbsp;</p></li><li><p><em>Application & Analysis: </em>Describe the purpose and implications of scientific experiments and observations. Explain how the results have led to the current state of scientific understanding. Apply scientific reasoning to deduce the implications of hypothetical experiments and observations.</p></li><li><p><em>Synthesis:</em> Explain how future experiments or observations could address open questions about the origins of life and potential for life beyond Earth.</p></li><li><em>Evaluation: </em>Critically evaluate claims and identify the extent to which data is inconclusive.</li></ul>
<p>Reading the textbook and online lessons will enable students meet the objectives of&nbsp;Knowledge & Comprehension. &nbsp;Posting and reading&nbsp;discussion board posts will help students meet objectives of Application & Analysis&nbsp;and give the opportunties to begin synthesizing and evaluating scientific claims. &nbsp;The Synthesis & Evaluation objectives will be further developed through writing two&nbsp;papers. &nbsp;Participating in a citizen science project will provide students experience analyzing real scientific data and positioningn them to&nbsp;synthesize their understanding of the scientific process. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Students will be assessed via a combination of&nbsp;online quizzes (Knowledge & Comprehension and Application & Analysis), discusssion board posts (some&nbsp;Knowledge & Comprehension, but&nbsp;primarily&nbsp;Application & Analysis), a class project (Application & Analysis), and two papers (Synthesis & Evaluation).</p>
