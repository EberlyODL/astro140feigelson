<h2>Project Phoenix</h2>
<p>About 1000 solar-like stars within 50 pc have been targeted with Parkes (Australia) 210-foot, Green Bank (West Virginia) 140-foot, and Arecibo (Puerto Rico) 1000-meter telescopes during the 1990s. ~50 million channels at 1-2 Hz resolution between 1-3 GHz (30-10 cm wavelength) are examined for continuous and pulsed signals, including frequency drifts.&nbsp; Stars with newly discovered planets are included in search. Private funding because Federal funding turned off in 1993 by Congress.&nbsp; Confirmation by an independent observatory required for identifying a candidate extreterrestrial signal.&nbsp; Main technical challenge: elimination of human radio interference.&nbsp; The image below shows frequency (horizontal axis) vs. time (vertical axis) brightness plot with an example of interference.</p>

<p><i>Excerpt from the <a href="https://www.seti.org/seti-institute/project/details/project-phoenix">Project Phoenix </a>diaries, March 21 2002 at Arecibo (by Seth Shostak, SETI Institute):</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px; ">Jane Jordan and I tried not to get too excited. A signal picked up while observing target 4505, a star very slightly dimmer than the Sun that's 117 light-years away, was persistent and passing all the usual tests. We moved the telescope off the star system, and the signal went away. We ran it back on the target, and the signal reappeared. It was looking good. We continued to examine 4505 until the Earth's rotation took it beyond Arecibo's field of view, and it looked good all the while.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px; ">Nonetheless, we've developed a certain&nbsp; resistance to easy adrenaline rushes. The microwave band is increasingly jammed by interference from orbiting satellites, so false alarms are common.&nbsp; As target 4505 drifted out of sight to the west, I wrote in the log book "should be&nbsp; re-observed." The next night, we did exactly that. This time the signal was seen not only in the direction of the star, but in other directions as well. Sadly, it was just more earthly interference, and definitely not extraterrestrial.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px; ">One of these days, this small scenario may end differently. And occasionally we think about that.&nbsp; It's after midnight. Jill Tarter has taken over the observing, so I walk outside the control room to the patio that overlooks the telescope. Overhead, the familiar&nbsp; winter constellations prick the humid air. Is there more out there than simply the&nbsp; frigid blackness of space and the silent boiling of the stars? Are there hidden places where the sounds of life are being made and heard? Do beings exist that&nbsp; can see the universe and understand what they see? It seems impossible to imagine otherwise.</p>
<h2>Allen Telescope Array</h2>
<p>Initially funded by Paul Allen, co-founder of Microsoft Corp, the <a href="https://www.seti.org/ata">Allen Telescope Array</a> of small antennas is being constructed in northern California for full-time SETI search.&nbsp; This will increase SETI studies by a factor of ~100 over current levels, observing 10<sup>5</sup>-10<sup>6</sup> stars and survey 4x10<sup>10</sup> stars in the inner Milky Way at 1420 MHz.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The ATA is a centimeter-wave array that pioneers the Large-Number Small-Diameter (LNSD) concept of building radio telescopes. By taking advantage of Moore’s Law, the designers are replacing steel with silicon, resulting in a large cost saving over telescopes of more conventional design. &nbsp;If completed, the ATA will ultimately comprise 350 6-meter dishes.</p>
<p>The ATA has four primary advantages for scientific studies over all major radio telescopes built to date: a very wide field-of-view (2.45° at λ = 21cm), complete instantaneous frequency coverage from 0.5 to 11.2 GHz, multiple simultaneous backends, and active interference mitigation. The instantaneous area of sky imaged is 17 times that of the VLA. The instantaneous frequency coverage of more than 4 octaves is unprecedented in radio astronomy. &nbsp;Unfortunately, the ATA has run out of money and is not continuously observing.</p>
