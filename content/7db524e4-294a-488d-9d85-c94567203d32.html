<p>In this introductory portion of the course, we have found that normal galaxies, forming billions of years ago after the Big Bang, form stars and planets continuously from their interstellar medium. The stars produce elements heavier than helium by nuclear fusion, and these atoms are ejected into the galaxy&#39;s interstellar medium. More stars and planets form in the cold interstellar clouds, now enriched with atoms from the furnaces in stars. We thus see a `cycle&#39; in the Galaxy, from stars to red giants which have winds and supernovae that enrich the interstellar medium the heavy elements, which then make more stars and planets. &nbsp;Planets, and life, are thus the result of the long `cycle&#39; of chemical enrichment the the Galaxy ... there could not be any planets right after the Big Bant, only billions of years later. &nbsp;</p>
<p>These heavier atoms combined to form a wide variety of molecules, many containing carbon.&nbsp;Interstellar clouds can be viewed as a laboratory of organic molecules diluted in the dominant hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>) and helium from the Big Bang. These chemicals are familiar to us -- water, molecules in Earth&#39;s atmosphere (O<sub>2</sub>, N<sub>2</sub>, CO<sub>2</sub>), methane and other hydrocarbons, alcohols and sugars. These are the molecules we see in our daily lives on the surface of Earth, the same molecules necessary for living organisms on Earth. &nbsp;Thus life, like planets, are the result of the repeated cycle of star formation and death in the galaxy. &nbsp;</p>
<p>We thus have traced profound links between the Universe, the galaxies, the stars, the interstellar medium, star and planet formation, and life on Earth. While some of this story was known ~50 years ago and Carl Sagan outlined it for the public ~30 years ago, many of the findings are very recent. Understanding the molecular universe, in particular, is a strong motivation for the most modern (and expensive) telescopes of the past ~10 years such as the infrared detecting Spitzer and Herschel Space Telescopes launched into space, and the ALMA millimeter telescope in Chile.</p>
