<p>OK, let's make our jargon simpler. &nbsp;Drake's equation refers to the number of life forms on habitable planets in the Galaxy that are intelligent in the sense that they have radio telescopes. &nbsp;Most of us&nbsp;have seen `science fiction' movies or read novels about such life forms ... and let's call them <strong>aliens&nbsp;</strong>just to use simpler teminology.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We can use our estimate of the Drake Equation to ask the question: <strong>What is the average distance between civilizations in the Galaxy?</strong></p>
<p>Consider that most stars lie in the Galactic disk (the Galactic halo has fewer stars and these have lower metallicities, so plausibly fewer planets).&nbsp; The Milky Way disk is roughly a cylinder with radius R and height h (in light years):</p>
<div style="text-align: center;">2 pi R<sup>2</sup> x h ~ 2 pi (100,000 ly)<sup>2</sup> 1,500 ly ~&nbsp; 1 x 10<sup>14</sup> cubic light years</div>
<p></p>
<p>Then the density of alien civilizations is their number divided by this volume:&nbsp;</p>
<center><p>Density of civilizations is = N<sub>i</sub> / (1 X 10<sup>14</sup>) civilizations per cubic light year</p></center>
<p>If they are randomly distributed throughout the Galactic disk (not necessarily true!), then the&nbsp;</p>
<center><p>Average distance between civilizations d = 1 / (Density)<sup>1/3</sup>&nbsp;= (1x10<sup>14</sup>/N<sub>i</sub>)<sup>1/3</sup> light years</p></center>
<div style="text-align: left;">So, if N<sub>i</sub>=100, the average distance between civilizations d ~ (1x10<sup>14</sup>/100)<sup>1/3</sup> = 10,000 ly.&nbsp; For N<sub>i</sub>=10,000, d ~ 2,000 ly.&nbsp; For N<sub>i</sub>=1,000,000, d ~ 500 ly.</div>
<p>The distance in light years is the time it takes to send a message in years. Twice this number is the time to send a message and get a reply.&nbsp; So, meaningful conversations can take place on the timescales of human societies (say, a human lifetime around 100 years) only if one takes extremely optimistic numbers in the Drake Equation resulting in many millions of civilizations.&nbsp; For less optimistic values, it is possible that civilizations can never meaningfully communicate (i.e. back-and-forth conversation) because the time to send/receive a message is longer than the duration of a civilization. Of course, if N<sub>i</sub>=1, we are the only communicable civilization, and there is no one else to talk to.</p>
<p>I would like to point out the nature of our argument here. This is not a philosophical, or subjective, discussion. It is quantitative. We are using arithmetic (Drake's equation), geometry (cylinder shape), and algebra (density estimation) to evaluate a quantity of interest (How far away are they?) for a reasonable range of values representing our empirical knowledge and uncertainty. This is an example of scientific inference -- the scientific method -- at work, even though the result is still uncertain.</p>
