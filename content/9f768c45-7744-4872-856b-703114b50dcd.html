<p>In 1961, astronomer Frank Drake developed a formula to estimate the number of intelligent species or communicable civilizations in our Galaxy that we could communicate with at this instant of time. The Drake Equation is not a real physical equation (like Newton's equations of motion and gravity), but it is a useful way to organize our knowledge and thoughts regarding the number of cummunicable civilizations in the Galaxy. &nbsp;We will see that reasonable estimates range from 1 (only us) to 10<sup>4</sup>. &nbsp;</p>

<center><strong>N<sub>i</sub> &nbsp;= N<sub>*</sub> x f<sub>h</sub> x N<sub>p</sub> x f<sub>e</sub> x f<sub>l</sub> x f<sub>i</sub> x L<sub>i</sub>/L<sub>MW</sub>&nbsp;</strong></center>
<div><p></p></div>
<div>Values need to be determined for each factor. Some can be calculated fairly easily, other are only rough guesses. A wide range of information is needed to determine N<sub>i</sub>.&nbsp;</div>
<p></p>
<div></div>
<div><strong>N<sub>*</sub> = Number of stars in the galaxy.</strong> &nbsp;Current estimates indicate that the mass of the Milky Way Galaxy is (except for distant Dark Matter) around 300 billion (3 x 10<sup>11</sup>) M<sub>o</sub>. &nbsp;The most common star has M~0.3 M<sub>o</sub>. &nbsp;We estimate there are roughly 300 billion (3 x 10<sup>11</sup>) to a&nbsp;trillion (1 x 10<sup>12</sup>) stars in the Milky Way. &nbsp; This is actually one of the best known terms in the Drake equation!</div>
<div></div>
<div><strong>f<sub>h</sub> = Fraction of these stars that can host habitable planets.</strong> &nbsp; The width of habitable zones depends critically on both the luminosity of the host star and the atmospheric conditions of the planet. &nbsp;High mass stars (OBAF) may evolve so fast that intelligent life would not have the time to develop (at least in a way similar to what happened on Earth). &nbsp;However, these stars are rare. &nbsp; M stars are most common, and some years ago there was concern that&nbsp;a planet&nbsp;in the habitable zone&nbsp;of an M star would be uninhabitable due to tidal&nbsp;locking&nbsp;and&nbsp;damaging stellar&nbsp;flares. &nbsp;But it is now widely considered that planets orbiting&nbsp;M stars are reasonable hosts for life forms. &nbsp;&nbsp;Stars in&nbsp;binary systems with 0.1-40AU &nbsp;separations will not permit planet on stable orbits in the habitable zone. &nbsp; Combining all of these ideas, some astronomers might&nbsp;estimate f<sub>h</sub>~0.5, while others might estimate f<sub>h</sub>~0.05, where differences stem largely from different ideas of what makes a star a good host for a habitable planet. &nbsp; While this range may seem large, it turns out there will be much larger uncertainties later on. &nbsp;Let's take a value of&nbsp;f<sub>h</sub>~0.1 here.&nbsp;</div>
<div></div>
<div><strong>N<sub>p</sub> = number of planets per star.</strong> Our own solar system has ~8 planets plus lots of minor bodies. &nbsp;Based on Kepler and microlensing&nbsp;results, we now are have clear observational evidence that, averaged over all stars,&nbsp;N<sub>p</sub>>0.5. &nbsp;Furthermore, a&nbsp;substantial&nbsp;fraction (10-30%) of planetary systems successfully detected with radial velocity, transit, or microlensing have multiple planets (2-7). But these our technologies are still limited: radial velocities can only detect heavier planets in closer orbits,&nbsp;transit searches miss most planets because the orbits are not aligned correctly for the planet to pass in front of the star from our viewpoint, microlensing depends on rare chance alignments of foreground and background stars,&nbsp;and so forth. So the true number of planets per host star must be higher. &nbsp;Planet formation calculations (e.g. oligarchic growth of planetary embryos) suggest that the most common outcome is likely to be a few to several planets spaced somewhat&nbsp;regularly&nbsp;in a&nbsp;configuration that is likely to be stable for billions of years. &nbsp; Reasonable estimates might range from N<sub>p</sub>=1&nbsp;to ~10 planets per star. &nbsp;Let's take a value of 5 planets here.&nbsp;</div>
<div></div>
<div><strong>f<sub>e</sub> = Fraction of the above planets to have Earth-like conditions suitable for life.</strong> &nbsp;This restricts planets of interest to those with rocky compositions and nearly-circular orbits in the Habitable Zone where water is liquid. &nbsp;The higher estimates of N<sub>p</sub> place most of the planets outside of the Habitable Zone, either too close (hot) or too far (cold). &nbsp;Planetary mass and atmospheric composition play an important role in habitability, e.g. through the carbonate-silicate cycle. &nbsp;In our own system, 1-2 out of 8 planets are suitable for life for extended periods (say, >1 Gyr). &nbsp;A handful of the thousands of known extrasolar planets fall within the Habitable Zone, though often with eccentric orbits. Using statistical extrapolation&nbsp;from the Kepler mission sample, several researchers estimate that roughly 1-10% of sun-like stars have planets between 1 and 1.6 times the radius of&nbsp;Earth&nbsp;planets with orbital periods vaguely near the Habitable Zone. &nbsp;However, there is worry that, although the temperature might allow surface&nbsp;liquid water, the atmosphere may have been evaporated by the host star, or otherwise have a composition inhospitable to life. &nbsp;Altogether, I suggest an&nbsp;estimate around&nbsp;f<sub>e</sub>~0.01-0.1; let's assume 0.02 here.&nbsp;</div>
<div></div>
<div><strong>f<sub>l</sub> = Fraction of the above "suitable planets" that lead to the development of primitive&nbsp;life forms. &nbsp;</strong>Miller-Urey experiments show&nbsp;that biotic material (e.g.. amino acids, lipids) can arise in an environment like the early Earth. &nbsp;Simple biotic material may also be brought in by infalling interstellar particles or comets. Life may take a wide variety of forms from sulfur metabolizing, deep-sea vent bacteria to oxygen-breathing animals. &nbsp;Nonetheless, there has been no success in producing self-reproducing macromolecular systems in the laboratory, so the mechanism of life formation is still unknown and we can not&nbsp;estimate its probability in a scientific or statistical way&nbsp;yet. &nbsp;The integrated probability over billions of years&nbsp;and over an entire planet is unknown. &nbsp;The probability of life getting started in a limited time or location might be very small. &nbsp;Alternatively, the origin of life may be nearly inevitable under the right conditions. &nbsp;In order to progress, let's&nbsp;assume <strong>f<sub>l</sub> =0.01</strong>; that is, one-in-a-hundred&nbsp;planets in the Habitable Zones actually develop simple&nbsp;living organisms.&nbsp;</div>
<p>f<sub>i</sub> = Fraction of the above planets with primitive life that develop advanced lifeforms, `communicating civilizations' that can communicate or travel between the stars. &nbsp;This is a question of the efficiency of biological evolution. &nbsp;We recall that, on Earth, only unicellular organisms existed&nbsp;from around 3.0 to 0.5 Gyr before the present. &nbsp;There were a variety of organisms (extremophiles, cyanobacteria, etc) but none were multicellular with different cell types. &nbsp;That began only at the beginning of the Cambrian Era ~500 million years ago when sponges, jellyfish, worms, etc. began to develop. &nbsp;We have little&nbsp;understanding of the causes of the Cambrian Explosion, and no way to scientifically or statistical estimate the probability that advanced civilizations will arise from a hypothetical group of planets with life. &nbsp;So this factor is nearly completely unknown. &nbsp;In order to progress, let's guess&nbsp;f<sub>i</sub> = 0.001; one in a thousand planets with simple life develop radio telescopes and space craft. &nbsp;</p>
<div><strong>L/L<sub>MW</sub> = Lifetime of communicating civilization / Lifetime of Milky Way. </strong>&nbsp;The lifetime of the Milky Way with stars having sufficiently high metallicity for planet formation is ~10 Gyr (10<sup>11</sup> yr). Our radio telescopes have been in existence less than ~10<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;years (since 1946). So on Earth today, this fraction is extremely small, ~10<sup>2</sup>/10<sup>11</sup> = 10<sup>-9</sup>. &nbsp;There is no scientific or statistical way to estimate a maximum to this value. &nbsp; Earth has had<strong>&nbsp;human-like mammals that can flexibly adapt their environments for a few million years. &nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;In order to progress, let's use this estimate and assume that advanced civilizations can last a million years, so&nbsp;<strong>L/L<sub>MW</sub> =</strong>10<sup>-5</sup>.<br>&nbsp;<p>OK, let's multiply:</p>
<p><strong>N<sub>i</sub> &nbsp;= N<sub>*</sub> x f<sub>h</sub> x N<sub>p</sub> x f<sub>e</sub> x f<sub>l</sub> x f<sub>i</sub> x L<sub>i</sub>/L<sub>MW</sub>&nbsp;</strong>=&nbsp;<strong>10<sup>12&nbsp;</sup>&nbsp;x 0.1 x 5 x 0.02 x 0.01 x&nbsp;0.001 x 10<sup>-5&nbsp;</sup>&nbsp; </strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; =&nbsp;10<sup>0&nbsp;</sup>&nbsp;~ 1 to 10&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Of course, we know there is at least one communicable civilization in the Galaxy today --&nbsp;&nbsp;ourselves -- so a lower limit is&nbsp;<strong>N<sub>i</sub> =1</strong>. &nbsp;Optimistic estimates for various factors could give&nbsp;<strong>N<sub>i</sub> &nbsp;=&nbsp;10<sup>6&nbsp;</sup>&nbsp;or more. &nbsp;A reasonable range is therefore&nbsp;</strong></p>
<center><p><strong>N<sub>i&nbsp;</sub>= 10<sup>0</sup> - 10<sup>6</sup></strong></p></center>
<div>In summary, we know so little that&nbsp;it is&nbsp;not crazy to consider the possibility of&nbsp;that thousands or millions&nbsp;of intelligent civilizations are now alive in the Galaxy. &nbsp;But if multiple terms in the Drake equation are quite small, then there might be only a few,or&nbsp;we might be the only communicating civilization in the Milky Way today. &nbsp;</div>
