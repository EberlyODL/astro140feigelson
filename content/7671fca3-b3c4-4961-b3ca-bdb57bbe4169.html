<p>We are adopting here an empirical approach based on the scientific method. A good scientific theory should be consistent with previous observations or experiments, make clear and detailed (and often quantitative) predictions that are observable or testable, and the results must be reproducible by other scientists under controlled conditions. In astronomy, we often rely on the assumption (validated many many times) that the laws of physics and properties of matter are the same throughout the observable&nbsp;Universe. Science rests on the philosophical assumptions that there is a real world, that our senses inform us about this external reality, and that the physical world behaves in a consistent and often comprehensible manner. &nbsp;This philosophical approach is called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positivism">Positivism</a>; it dates back to Plato in ancient Greece and grew to prominence in the 18th century as Newton's mathethematical laws of physics became widely accepted. &nbsp;</p>
<h2>Examples of strong arguments relating to&nbsp;Life in the Universe</h2>
<ul><li>We infer the existence of habitable planets orbiting ordinary nearby stars from periodic variations in the stars' radial velocity and from the transits of the planets across the star's disk. A few of these planets are in the star's Habitable Zone where life could develop. These results are convincing because they are quantitatively interpreted using Newton's laws of gravity & motion.</li><li>&nbsp;We infer the existence of dozens of species of molecules in astronomical environments (molecular clouds, protoplanetary disks, comet tails, Jovian moons) which are essential to terrestrial life. This is convincing because quantum mechanics gives precise predictions regarding the emission lines of molecules.</li><li>We infer that all living organisms on Earth (bacteria, grass, bee, humans, etc) are descended from a single line of primitive organisms 3-4 Gyr (giga-year or billion years) ago. This is convincing because biochemical/cellular studies show tremendous similarity in the chemistry (DNA, proteins, metabolism) and genetic codes of organisms today, and because of interpretations of the fossil record combined with radioactive dating of rock layers.</li></ul>
<h2>Example of a weak argument relating to&nbsp;Life in the Universe</h2>
<p>The presence or absence of UFOs is very difficult to interpret in a convincing fashion:</p>
<ul><li style="text-align: left;"><strong>Pro:</strong> Unidentified Flying Objects demonstrate that technologically advanced extraterrestrial living organisms are now visiting Earth. &nbsp;This is unconvincing because the explanation involving alien spacecraft is only one of several possibilities (e.g.&nbsp;witness mistakes or hoaxes). It would be convincing if we had some physical object from these visits that could be studied in scientific laboratories to show that the object is not from Earth.&nbsp;</li><li style="text-align: left;"><strong>Con:</strong> The absence of clear visits from extraterrestrial civilizations demonstrates that no extraterrestrial civilizations exist in the Galaxy. This is known as Fermi's (or Tipler's) argument. &nbsp;But &nbsp;a general argument is made from a narrow finding. &nbsp;It is possible that&nbsp;extraterrestrial civilizations exist in the Galaxy today with technology that could travel to Earth, but they have not done so. &nbsp;Maybe they haven't found Earth (lots of other nice habitable planets for vacations!) or have chosen not to visit for some unknown reason.</li></ul>
<p>So, while the astronomical evidence for habitable exoplanets orbiting other stars is quite convincing from a scientific viewpoint (even though the findings are quite recent), the various arguments cooncerning Unidentified Flying Objects are not very convincing in one direction or the other. &nbsp;This is the kind of judgments we will seek during the course, particular in the Papers and Discussion. &nbsp;Note that scientific arguments are not black-and-white. (In contrast, mathematical arguments can be absolutely right or wrong; for example, 2+2=5 is wrong). Science progresses by preponderance of evidence, confirmation and contradiction of predictions -- not logical proof. Thus, scientific conclusions at any given time can be wrong, particularly at the frontiers of knowledge. Scientific conclusions are not comprehensive and complete; there are many important questions which have not been successfully approached using the scientific method. On the examples above, we have not disproved the hypothesis "UFOs are from outer space" just because the evidence to date is unconvincing.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">But collectively and over time, the powerful growth of mutually supporting scientific evidence and theories convinces large communities of scholars that we are on the right track of understanding the universe around us. We thus see progress from scientific knowledge to scientific understanding. As we gain understanding of different aspects of the universe, we also gain the ability to manipulate the physical world to our advantage. This leads to modern technologies: automobiles and jet airplanes, electricity and the Internet, medicines to treat diseases, and so forth.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">During this course, we will be discussing issues where scientific knowledge and understanding is relevant to the question of Life in the Universe:</p>
<ul><li style="text-align: left;">cosmology and structures in the universe</li><li style="text-align: left;">production of chemical elements and molecules in the Galaxy</li><li style="text-align: left;">formation and evolution of planets orbiting stars</li><li style="text-align: left;">concepts of habitability on planets</li><li style="text-align: left;">origin of life on planets</li><li style="text-align: left;">interrelationships between life and planetary atmospheres</li><li style="text-align: left;">possibilities of intelligent life on other planets</li></ul>
<p style="text-align: left;">Some of this understanding is well-established (e.g. cosmology, synthesis of elements in stars), some is at the forefront of current research (e.g. formation of planets, life-atmosphere interrelationships), and some still have very little evidence and knowledge (e.g. origin of life, intelligent extraterrestrial life).</p>
