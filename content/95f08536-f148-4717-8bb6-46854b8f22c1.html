<p>Einstein's Special Relativity requires that travel by massive objects occur at sub-light speeds, and light-based communication travels at the speed of light. If habitable planets are relatively common (as recent astronomical discoveries suggest), typical distances between them may be (say) tens of light years. It will thus take decades to send/receive a message, and many/many years to travel between these planets. This would resemble the 17th century when it took weeks for a ship to travel between Europe and the Americas -- but much slower. Meaningful interchange between the home planet and colonies will be ineffective, and colonies will be largely independent. A tightly knit Galactic Empire is thus very unlikely.</p>
<p>Colonizing the Galaxy, however, could occur surprisingly rapidly if interstellar space travel were achieved. Imagine that we or another intelligent species did acquire the technology (and desire) to colonize neighboring habitable planets. Let us guess:</p>
<ul><li>The PMXZVQ civilization travels at v=0.1c so it takes 500 years to reach a habitable planet 50 lightyears away.</li><li>They take 4000 years for the colony to get settled, establish farms and factories, communicate with home base 50 times, and build new spaceships.</li><li>They proceed onto new habitable planets, reaching the nearest in 500 years.</li></ul>
<p>The civilization would thus radiate outward from its original planet at roughly 50 LY/5000 yrs or 50,000 LY in 50 million years. The entire Galaxy could thus be colonized in 10<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;yrs. This is only 1/500th the age of the Sun and 0.0001 times the age of the Galaxy -- an extremely brief moment!</p>
<p>Some scholars (e.g. Enrico Fermi, Frank Tipler) use this calculation to conclude that no spacefaring civilization has yet existed in the Galaxy. If it had, Earth would have rapidly been colonized at least once, perhaps many times. Yet we have no clear evidence of ancient or present alien civilizations, and we find no non-DNA-based lifeforms. Maybe we are alone in the Galaxy? Perhaps the development of intelligent life is very rare, or even life itself is rare? This line of reasoning is nicknamed the <b> Fermi paradox </b> (thought it isn't really a paradox, just a logical argument). It is discussed briefly in Chpt 9.5 of our textbook.</p>
<p>A great deal has been said about the Fermi paradox -- `Where are the aliens?' --&nbsp;mostly empty speculation. &nbsp;But I can recommend a few contributions:</p>

<p><big><b>Conclusion: Travel between "uninhabited but habitable" planets may be significantly easier that travel between the rare intelligent civilizations, as the discovery of many extrasolar planets indicates planetary systems around solar-type stars are common.&nbsp; The distances to travel may be ~10 lightyears to ~1000 lightyears.&nbsp; It is conceivable a civilization could achieve this: one-way invasion/colonization of the Milky Way Galaxy is not impossible.&nbsp; However, the planets will be largely decoupled from each other, and a meaningful Galactic civilization (government, trade, culture, etc) seems unachievable.</b>&nbsp;</big></p>
