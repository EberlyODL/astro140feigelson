<p><strong>Galaxies: The home of stars and planets </strong></p>
<p>Even though the Universe has been expanding since the Big Bang, dispersing the atoms and cooling the light, gravity is still present. On local scales, atoms attracted each other, forming early stars and then galaxies. We have little observational knowledge about this phase of the Universe&#39;s history, hence its nickname `the Dark Ages&#39;. It lasted roughly from 1 million to 1 billion years after the Big Bang, or the first few percent of the Universe&#39;s current age. Astrophysicists argue that an early generation of stars formed during this time, quickly going supernova and polluting the gas with small amounts of elements heavier than helium. Detailed models show that gravitational attraction (involving both Dark Matter and regular matter) produced dense sheets and filaments that then collapsed to form galaxies and galaxy clusters. Big galaxies cannibalize smaller ones, and mergers of big galaxies are common. Massive black holes formed at the center of most galaxies at the same time.</p>

	<p>Take a look at recent computer simulations of gravitational collapse in the expanding Universe. These are very complicated calculations based on the latest cosmological model (with Dark Matter and Dark Energy) requiring the world&#39;s most powerful computers.&nbsp; The first&nbsp;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C_dnP2fvxk" style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; ">movie</a>&nbsp;(1 min) shows a calculation the formation of large-scale structure from the University of Chicago.

<p>While galaxy collisions still occur occasionally today, ~12 billion years after the violent Dark Ages, most galaxies are quiet and stable, serenely spinning through space. Most large galaxies have a flattened disk with a pinwheel pattern of `spiral arms&#39; where stars and planets form. See the photos above of nearby spiral galaxies, including own Milky Way Galaxy. Because the Sun lies in the disk of our Galaxy, we cannot see its structure as we can with distant face-on galaxies. We study the detailed formation of stars and planets in the nearby spiral arms of our Galaxy.</p>

<p>A composite photo of our Galaxy as seen from Earth is shown above. &nbsp;Note the similarity to NGC 891, another spiral galaxy seen edge-on. Below is an artist drawing, consistent with modern observations, showing our Galaxy &nbsp;as it would appear if seen face-on. &nbsp;Note the Sun is about 25,000 light-years (8000 parsecs) from the center, and lies between two spiral arms. The central region of the Galaxy has a large bar, and a modest 3x10<sup>6</sup> M<sub>o</sub> massive black hole lies at the very core.</p>

<h2>The Interstellar Medium</h2>
<p>The images of the Milky Way (above) and other galaxies (previous page) were made in visible light, the waveband where the surfaces of stars shine. Their temperatures are thousands of degrees Kelvin (above absolute zero). But the dark clouds where stars and planets form are much colder, only tens or hundreds of degrees Kelvin. These `shine&#39; in the microwave and infrared bands of light, and in particular exhibit the emission lines and bands produced by particular molecules. <strong>Read the `Sidebar: Understanding molecules&#39; (next page) for background.</strong></p>
<p>Interstellar clouds nearby in the Milky Way can be oddly beautiful in photographs. The first two images below show the Eagle Nebula and the Orion Nebula in visible light, as seen with the Hubble Space Telescope. The Eagle shows dark pillars of cold gas and dust illuminated by a nearby hot star. A few stars (probably with planets) are forming now in these pillars. Orion recently (about 1-2 million years ago) formed a rich cluster of stars (probably with planets). The dark cloud is behind the cluster, and the edge is brightly shining due to heating by the hottest Orion stars. The third image a much larger cloud as viewed in the infrared with the Spitzer Space Telescope. The light here is from vibrations of soot-like hydrocarbon molecules. The final image below shows recent research maps of two emission lines of the ammonia molecule (NH<sub>3</sub>) in a small dark cloud that is likely to form stars soon.</p>

<p>The result of several decades of molecular spectroscopy of interstellar clouds has shown an amazing variety of molecules in a gas that is mostly hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>) and helium. Most of these molecules are organic; that is, they containing carbon. Some are quite simple molecules: carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>), methane (CH<sub>4</sub>), hydrogen cyanide (HCN). But others are more complex: ethane (C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>), ether (CH<sub>3</sub>OCH<sub>3</sub>), ethanol (CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>OH), acetone (CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>3</sub>CO), acetic acid (CH<sub>3</sub>COOH), a simple sugar (CH<sub>2</sub>OHCHO), antifreeze (HOCH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>OH), and controversially, possibly an amino acid (NH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>COOH). Some interstellar molecules are not organic (that is, without carbon): water (H<sub>2</sub>O), nitrogen (N<sub>2</sub>), ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub>), hydrochloric acid (HCl), salt (NaCl), sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>), and so forth. Some molecules happen to have emission lines at wavelengths that are technically difficult to detect. This is the reason that the oxygen molecule (O<sub>2</sub>) was not discovered until 2011 using the new Herschel Space Telescope.</p>
