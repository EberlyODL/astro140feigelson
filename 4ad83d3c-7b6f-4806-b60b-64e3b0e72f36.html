<ul><li><em><strong>The Universe formed in a Big Bang</strong></em> 13.7 billion years ago with early conditions leading to protons, neutrons and electrons .... lots of Dark Matter, hydrogen and helium in an expanding space-time.</li><li>Gravity pulls the matter inwards locally, <em><strong>producing galaxies, stars over billions of years</strong></em>. &nbsp;The stars fuse H and He to heavier elements like carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, silicon and iron. &nbsp;The stars eject some of this processed material back into the galaxies, so that <em><strong>new generations of stars can form with chemically enriched protoplanetary disks</strong></em>.&nbsp;</li><li>Astronomers see these protoplanetary disks around all stars forming in nearby molecular clouds today. &nbsp;<em><strong>The disks have the basic molecules of planets and life</strong></em>: silicates and soot for the rocky bodies, CO<sub>2</sub>+H<sub>2</sub>O+NH<sub>3</sub>... for the atmospheres.</li><li>Astronomers have now detected the resulting planetary systems around thousands of stars using sensitive techniques such as Doppler radial velocities, planetary transits, and microlensing. &nbsp;We infer that <em><strong>virtually all stars have planets</strong></em>, and that <em><strong>many are Earth-like planets in Habitable Zones</strong></em> where surface water can be liquid.</li><li><em><strong>Robotic probes to Mars, asteroids and the outer Jovial systems reveal that liquids are (or were) present</strong></em> in various locations in our Solar System. &nbsp;Mars once has flowing rivers and seas of water, Europa and other Jovian moons have liquid water oceans under the surface ice, and Titan has a unique ecology of methane+ethane streams and lakes. &nbsp;<em><strong>No living organisms have been found outside Earth</strong></em>, but these environments conceivably could be inhabited by extremophile-like micro-organisms.&nbsp;</li><li><em><strong>The evolution of life on Earth is now well-understood</strong></em>: the processes studied by Charles Darwin have been spectacularly confirmed by studies of DNA genetic sequences. &nbsp;All lifeforms share a common heritage with similar biochemistry, cell biology and genetics. &nbsp;Archaea (often extremophile) bacteria are the most ancient organisms. &nbsp;<em><strong>But the original formation of a self-reproducing cell from inorganic components on the early Earth is still not understood</strong></em>. &nbsp;</li><li>With billions of habitable planets in the Galaxy now inferred from exoplanet studies, the possibilities of extraterrestrial life rests on a stronger scientific foundation than in the past. &nbsp;<em><strong>However, there is no convincing evidence of extraterrestrial life from any type of study</strong></em>: &nbsp;astronomical observations (SETI), robotic probes (Solar System), terrestrial studies (UFOs, etc). &nbsp;</li><li><em><strong>We do not know whether we are the only technologically developed life form in the Galaxy, or whether &nbsp;there are many other advanced alien civilizations</strong></em>. &nbsp;Either possibility is reasonable. &nbsp;Interstellar communication between civilizations (ours or others) on proximate habitable planets is not difficult. &nbsp;Interstellar travel between habitable planets is extremely difficult, but not physically impossible.</li></ul>
<p style="margin-left: 40px; "><strong><em>In conclusion, life exists in the Universe ... on Earth. &nbsp;The conditions for life arising elsewhere are widespread: there are lots of similar planets with similar surface conditions and similar chemistry. &nbsp;But we do not know if extraterrestrial life is indeed present, or whether it has evolved to be technologically advanced on any planet except Earth.</em></strong></p>
