<p>In this project, you will contribute to an actual citizen science research effort to analyze real astronomical data from NASA's Kepler spacecraft. Your contribution will help astronomers learn about how many stars in our galaxy might have planets orbiting them. This is a serious project that will take several hours to complete, so please plan ahead and budget your time accordingly. &nbsp; You may choose to read about the project now, and perhaps even to start on this project the very first week. &nbsp;That said, I fully expect that students will proceed to lessons for Theme 1, and come back to this page later as they make progress on the project. &nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Your mission:</em> Look for planet transits and classify light curves from NASA’s Kepler spacecraft based on the star’s temporal variability.</p>
<p><strong>I. Getting Started</strong></p>
<p>First, make sure you have watched my&nbsp;PlanetHunters video tutorial&nbsp;that&nbsp;provides an overview of how to use the PlanetHunters website to hunt for planets and to recognize other causes of stellar variability.</p>
<p><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="450" src="https://psu.voicethread.com/app/player/?threadId=8064118" width="800"></iframe></p>
<p>Second, go to the PlanetHunters website (<a href="http://PlanetHunters.org" target="_blank">http://PlanetHunters.org</a>), sign up for an account (or log in again if you already created an account), and complete the introductory tutorial.&nbsp; Go ahead and quickly inspect at least few light curves looking for any possible transits, just to get the hang of it.&nbsp; Then, explore the other features of the website, as described in the video tutorial.&nbsp; In particular, review the different types of light curves you may see in the “Spotter’s Guide”.&nbsp; Once you are ready to start the main part of the project, continue to section 2.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>II.&nbsp; Inspect & Classify Light Curves </strong>(30%)</p>
<p>In this step, you will inspect and classify at least 50 light curves.&nbsp; You’ll record your results into a data tables, using one row for each light curve you examine.&nbsp; First, make sure you are logged into Planethunters.org, click the “Start Classifying Planets” button or “Classify” tab to get started.</p>
<p>Inspect your first light curve and draw a box around any potential transits, as described in the tutorial. &nbsp;Before you move on, classify each light curve according to the type of stellar activity using the following three categories:</p>
<p><strong>a) <em>Quiet</em></strong><em>:</em> This is for light curves that do not show systematic variation. Any vertical scatter in the points is attributed to "noise". The spread of the scatter should be no more than about 0.05%.</p>
<p><strong>b) <em>Spotty</em></strong><em>:</em> These light curves show clear and generally smooth variation.&nbsp; There will not necessarily be a systematic repeating pattern, but there are often quaesi-periodic variations with a timescale of days to weeks.</p>
<p><strong>c) <em>Pulsating</em></strong><em>:</em> These light curves also show clear variation, and with a quaesi-periodic pattern that repeats. The timescale of the pulsations are typically minutes to hours, significantly more rapid than spotty stars.</p>
<p>Record your interpretation into a <a href="https://psu.box.com/v/planethunterstable" target="_blank">data table</a> using one row per light curve (see next page).&nbsp; For each light curve, record your classification it into one of the three categories by placing a 1 in that column. Place zeros in the boxes for the other categories of stellar activity in the same row.&nbsp; There are two additional columns to indicate if you identify a potential transit and for any notes you wish to record.&nbsp; If you think you see one or more transits, enter the number of potential transits in the Transits column.&nbsp; Note that you might not see any real planet transits during your entire project.&nbsp; (If you mark a light curve as containing a transit, it should also be marked as belonging to one of the previous three categories.) Once you’re ready to move on, click the button at the bottom right (either “No Transits” or “Finished”).&nbsp;</p>
<p>The next screen will have some additional information.&nbsp; Record the “Zooniverse id” (at the bottom left in small font) for the star you just classified into your data table.&nbsp; If you found something interesting, consider marking the light curve as a “Favorite” and/or leaving a comment about what interested you.&nbsp; This will make it easier for you to come back to review your most interesting light curves near the end of the project.&nbsp; Now, click next subject, and repeat for the next light curve.</p>
<p>Repeat the above process for at least 50 stars.&nbsp; I encourage you to take breaks, so you stay fresh.&nbsp; You can return as many time as you like over multiple days (remember your username) to classify dozens of light curves.&nbsp; If you choose to use a printed copy of the <a href="https://psu.box.com/v/planethunterstable" target="_blank">data table</a>, then you will need to print out several pages.&nbsp; If you are using a spreadsheet with your data table, then add new rows as necessary to contain all your results. When you are finished, every box should have a number in it. Do not leave any boxes blank when you submit.</p>
<p><em>Suggestion:&nbsp; </em>You will report your results of Sections III, IV & V in the Canvas via the assignment named "PlanetHunter Project Results".&nbsp; I suggest that you print out a copy of the questions you'll be asked to answer from Canvas, and perform the analysis and calculations in sections III & IV, writing down your responses as you go (either on paper or a text file).&nbsp; Then you go back into the Canvas assignment, upload your data table from section II, enter your results from Section III & IV, and respond to the final questions in Section V.</p>
<p><strong>III.&nbsp; Analyze your Data &nbsp;</strong>(30%)</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Review your data table.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You’ll report a summary of your results in Count the total number of light curves you classified (and recorded in your data table).&nbsp;</p>
<ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha;"><li>Count the number of light curves that you categorized as “quiet”.</li><li>Count the number of light curves that you classified as “spotty”.&nbsp;</li><li>Count the number of light curves that you classified as “pulsating”.&nbsp;</li><li>Count the number of light curves that you identified as having a potential transit.</li><li>Compute the percentage of light curves that you classified into each category.&nbsp; You can use the formula:&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Percentage in given category = 100% * (Number in category) / (Total Number Inspected).&nbsp;</li><li>What is the percentage of light curves that you identified as having a potential transit?&nbsp;</li></ol>
<p></p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Review your most interesting light curves. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, that you’ve reviewed many light curves, you are likely to be able to recognize common patterns more easily.&nbsp; Go back to review the light curves that you marked as potentially containing a transit.&nbsp; (If you didn’t mark at least three as likely to contain a transiting planet, then use the light curves that you found most interesting, so that you review at least three stars.&nbsp; You can access a light curve again by clicking “Talk” at the top of the PlanetHunters classification page, and then click “Search” at the top of the TalkPlanetHunters page, enter the “Zooniverse ID” of the light curve you want to review in the textbox below “Search For”, and click “Search”.&nbsp; Then your object should appear on the right.&nbsp; Click on your object’s Zooniverse ID, and you will have access to <em>the entire Kepler light curve </em>for that star.*&nbsp; Note that typically you will now be presented with much more data than when you first reviewed the same star’s light curve.&nbsp; Below the lightcurve, there is a label “Quarters” and a list of light curves segments (e.g., “1-1”, “1-2”, “1-3”, “2-1”, … “17-3”).&nbsp; When you first reviewed the light curve, you were presented with just one of these segments. Now, you can review all the available data for the star.&nbsp; Click on each of the quarters to review each segment of the light curve.&nbsp;</p>
<p>* = You can also review a list of the light curves that you analyzed by choosing “Profile” at the top of the planethunters classification page.&nbsp; If you marked some light curves as a “favorite” in planethunters, then you can find those by clicking “Favorites”.&nbsp; If you entered a comment about some light curves, then you can find those by clicking “Talk” at the top of the planethunters classification page and then “Profile” on the TalkPlanetHunters page.</p>
<p>After reevaluating the interesting light curves you found, answer the following questions:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha;"><li>Which light curves do you still consider likely to contain a good transiting planet candidate?&nbsp; (List their ZooinvereIDs.)</li><li>What is the percentage of light curves with a good transiting planet candidate relative to the total number of light curves in your data table?</li><li>The Kepler mission monitored the brightness of ~192,000 stars in search of transits and identified approximately 4,696 planet candidates. What is the rate of planet candidates per star (expressed as a percentage) based on the Kepler mission?&nbsp;</li><li>How does the percentage of transiting planet candidates based on your analysis compare to the frequency of planet candidates identified by the Kepler Mission?</li><li>If your % is similar, explain whether this is surprising or not, and why. If your number is different, explain why you think this is so. &nbsp;In either case, list at least three possible reasons, and sort them by which are think is more significant (from most significant to least significant).</li><li>Which of the light curves above do you consider to be your “best” transiting planet candidate?</li></ol>
<p><strong>IV.&nbsp; Quantitative Analysis of One Planet Candidate &nbsp;</strong>(30%)</p>
<p>Next, you will estimate a putative planet’s orbital period and size, based on the light curve with your best planet candidate.&nbsp; If you have no good planet candidates, then you may use the star APH000067z.&nbsp; You may wish to review the PlanetHunters video tutorial for tips to help you measure the transit depth and duration.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha;"><li>What is the Zooniverse ID of the star that you are analyzing for this section?</li><li>Find two to five putative transits.&nbsp; (You may need to look in multiple quarters.)&nbsp; Zoom in around each and report the approximate mid-times of each transit.&nbsp; Use the times on the scale at the top of the light curves.&nbsp; (The times along the bottom axis reset each segment, so can’t be compared across multiple segments.)</li><li>Are the times of the putative transits consistent with a single orbital period?&nbsp; If so, what is the approximate orbital period?</li><li>What is the typical brightness level of the points outside of a transit?&nbsp; (No units needed; brightness is in arbitrary / relative units.)</li><li>What is the typical brightness level of the points inside of the transit? (again, no units needed)</li><li>What is the transit depth? The formula for depth is (transit depth) equals (out-of-transit brightness minus in-transit brightness) divided by (out-of-transit brightness).</li><li>Measure the starting time of a transit.&nbsp; Measure the ending time of a transit.&nbsp; Compute the transit duration.&nbsp; (transit duration) = (transit end time) minus (transit start time).</li><li>If there are many transits in the same light curve, then measure the transit depth and duration for at least five transits.&nbsp;</li><li>Are your measurements of the depths and durations of different transits are consistent with each other?&nbsp; Does this result favor or disfavor the planet hypothesis?</li><li>What is the average of your measured transit depths?<br>(Use this average in the calculations below.)</li><li>What is the radius of the putative planet relative to the radius of the star?<br>The formula is (planet radius)/(star radius) = square root(transit depth).</li><li>What is the radius of the putative planet relative to the radius of the Sun?<br>(planet radius)/(radius of sun) = (planet radius)/(star radius) * (star radius)/(radius of sun)<br>For most stars, the radius of the star (divided by the radius of the sun) will be reported below the light curve, after “Radius” and above “Kepler ID”.</li><li>What is the radius of the putative planet relative to the radius of Jupiter?&nbsp;<br>The radius of the sun is approximately 10 times the radius of Jupiter.</li><li>Given your measurement of the planet’s radius, is the putative transiting object more likely to be a planet or eclipsing binary star?</li><li>What is the radius of the putative planet relative to the radius of Earth?&nbsp;<br>The radius of the sun is approximately 100 times the radius of Earth.</li><li>If this star were to have another transiting planet whose radius was equal to that of the Earth, how likely would you be have noticed the Earth-size planet’s transits?&nbsp;</li></ol>
