<p>Life of Earth today exhibits tremendous diversity:</p>
<ul><li>Green grasses uses solar blackbody radiation plus H<sub>2</sub>O and CO<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;from the atmosphere to grow and produce grass seeds.</li><li>A white fungus grows on a dead tree in the forest, obtaining water and carbon-based molecules from the tree rather than the atmosphere, and may reproduce nearly in place so as to gradually cover more of the tree (and perhaps break off and be moved to a new location by wind or&nbsp;another animal) or may create spores to spread similar to seeds.</li><li>Humans consume H<sub>2</sub>O and&nbsp;organic molecules from plants and animals plus O<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;from the atmosphere to grow, move around and make&nbsp;baby humans through sexual reproduction. &nbsp;</li><li>Bacteria near mid-oceanic ridges at the ocean floor use&nbsp;sulfur-based chemicals and/or geothermal heat to grow and reproduce in darkness. &nbsp;</li></ul>
<p>It is extremely difficult to write an complete definition that includes all of this variety of life on Earth, let alone one that is useful for the search of extraterrestrial life. &nbsp;Here are two possibilities (see our text sec 1.1.1 for a similar discussion):&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px; "><strong>A living organism is something that can reproduce and evolve through natural selection.</strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px; "><strong>A living organism extracts and organizes energy and material from its environment to preserve its existence, grow and produce similar independent organisms.</strong></p>
<p>The fact that scientists seriously consider two definitions that are so different from each other&nbsp;demonstrates how hard it is to develop a good&nbsp;definition for life.&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, these definitions do not have some criteria satisfied by all terrestrial (Earth-based) life, such as `constituted of carbon-based molecules' or `require liquid&nbsp;water as a solvent during some phase of their life'. &nbsp;This is intentional. &nbsp;We wonder if life forms could exist on other planets that have different chemistries and solvents. &nbsp;For example, we will learn shortly that Saturn's moon Titan has rain/streams/lakes of liquid methane that are extremely different from environments on Earth, but it is not inconceivable that they&nbsp;could harbor life.</p>
<p>Most scientists agree that some things are <em><strong>not</strong></em> alive:</p>
<ul><li><b>Star<i>&nbsp;</i></b>It has a well-defined life-cycle (protostar --> main sequence star --> red giant --> white dwarf or neutron star) and interacts with its environs (formed by gravitational collapse of ambient gas, illuminates planets).&nbsp; But a star does not actively organize external energy or material and does not reproduce. &nbsp;</li><li><b>Planet</b><i>&nbsp;</i>It has a complex internal and atmospheric structure and could be said to extract and organize energy from its host star, but&nbsp;the key planet properties were set near the time of its formation based on the mass and&nbsp;angular momentum of the material that formed the planet. &nbsp;While a planet may be said to `evolve' as in change properties, it does not&nbsp;reproduce, therefore it does not `evolve' in the technical sense refering to natural selection. &nbsp;</li><li><b>Robot or computer program?&nbsp;</b>&nbsp; Some computer programs are effective at learning from repeated trials. They fall underthe rubrics of `machine learning algorithms' or, less technically, `artificial intelligence' (AI). When an AI software system is connected to mechanical device, it is often called a robot. It is still unclear whether some future AI will achieve human-like self-awareness and creativity (though this is not a requirement for life). This issue addressed in a thoughtful way by the 2004 Hollywood movie&nbsp;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0343818/" style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; " target="_blank"><em><strong>I,&nbsp;Robot</strong></em></a>. It is debated whether a robot/AI could be built that is programmed to make a similar new robot (known as a Turing machine) and, if so, would it be alive? But we are far from having robots reproduce and evolve through natural selection. &nbsp;You might find interesting some discussions of these issues with leading scientists <a href="https://theconversation.com/ask-the-experts-will-robots-take-over-the-world-16791">here</a> and&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://theconversation.com/how-we-built-a-robot-that-can-evolve-and-why-it-wont-take-over-the-world-52506">here</a>.</li><li><strong>Virus? &nbsp;</strong>These are exceedingly small biological structures consisting of protein and&nbsp;RNA/DNA that invade living cells and use their DNA-->RNA-->protein machinery to reproduce themselves. &nbsp;Viruses are&nbsp;based on same chemistry as living organisms on Earth but are parasitic, requiring&nbsp;host cells for reproduction. &nbsp;It is not clear whether they should be considered living organisms. &nbsp;</li></ul>
