<p>Modern science began roughly 400 years ago in Europe with study of phenomena around us: study of the forces regulating the interaction of objects (physics), study of the composition of objects (chemistry), and study of living organisms (biology). Modern scientific theories, observations and experiments build upon themselves, creating an amazing edifice of knowledge and understanding. In many cases, we use our knowledge and understanding to build advanced devices that allow further discovery of phenomena and testing of theory. For example, we use our knowledge of light, optics, electronics, materials and spacecraft to construct superb telescopes that can see billions of times fainter than the human eye, and at wavelengths we can&#39;t see at all. We use our understanding of thermodynamics, gases, materials, and the chemistry of combustion to design jet airplanes that fly us around the world. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Physical processes for many situations were found to have an underpinning in advanced mathematics (calculus, differential equations, group theory, differential geometry). We (or at least, I) really don&#39;t know why the Universe is regulated by mathematical laws of physics. &nbsp;Here are a few of the major advances in the the emergence of modern science:</p>
<ul>
	<li>In the late-1600s, Isaac Newton derived differential equations that explain the motions and mechanics of interacting bodies (for instance, the motion of a kicked football or the motion of the Moon around the Earth)</li>
	<li>In the late-1800s, Ludwig Boltzmann and others generalized these equations to explain the behaviors of fluids, gasses and stars. This includes thermodynamics, fluid mechanics, stellar systems, and so forth.</li>
	<li>During the 1700-1900s, chemists found that matter is composed of combinations of ~100 elements: hydrogen, helium, carbon, iron, and so forth. Their properties could be organized in the Periodic Table of the Elements. &nbsp;Browse the interactive <a href="http://www.ptable.com/" target="_blank">Periodic Table of the Elements</a>. The most important elements for living organisms on Earth are hydrogen (H), carbon (C], oxygen (O), and nitrogen (N). Our bodies also have phosphorus (P] in our DNA, calcium (Ca) in our bones, iron (Fe) in our blood, and small amounts of other elements.</li>
	<li>In the early-1900s, many physicists found that behaviors within atoms are quantized; that is, only specific energies are permitted. Quantum mechanics provided a profound explanation for the periodic table of the elements, atomic and molecular spectra, and much more.</li>
	<li>In the late-1900s, biochemists and cell biologists recognized that a complicated polymer known as DNA carries the genetic information in living organisms that provides a code for the production of proteins and for passing that information on to offspring.</li>
	<li>In the late-1900s and early 2000s, particle physicists established the foundations of matter in the form of quarks and other elementary particles, including the Higgs boson discovered in 2013. These are understood within a theory based on quantum mechanics.</li>
	<li>From the early-1990s to the present, astronomers have established that the universe is expanding from a `Big Bang&#39; event ~14 Gyr ago. &nbsp;The theory is well-established and agrees well with diverse datasets, but implies that the Universe is filled with Dark Matter and Dark Energy which we have not detected in the laboratory. &nbsp;</li>
