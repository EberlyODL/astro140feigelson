<h2>How Many Intelligent Civilizations are in the Galaxy Today?</h2>

<p>In 1961, astronomer Frank Drake developed a formula to estimate the number of intelligent species or communicable civilizations in our galaxy that we could communicate with at this instant of time. The <b>Drake Equation&nbsp;</b>is still used to estimate the number of cummunicable civilizations in the Galaxy. Reasonable estimates range from 1 (only us) to 10<sup>8</sup>.</p>

	<p><strong>N<sub>i&nbsp;</sub>&nbsp;= N<sub>*</sub>&nbsp;x f<sub>p&nbsp;</sub>x N<sub>p</sub>&nbsp;x f<sub>e</sub>&nbsp;x f<sub>l&nbsp;</sub>x f<sub>i&nbsp;</sub>x L<sub>i</sub>/L<sub>MW</sub></strong></p>
</center>

<p>Values need to be determined for each factor. Some can be calculated fairly easily, other are extremely uncertain estimates. A wide range of information is needed to determine <strong>N<sub>i</sub></strong>. &nbsp;Note that this is not a real equatlion of physics, like Newton's equations of motion and gravity. &nbsp;Rather, it is a way to organize ones thinking about life in the Universe. &nbsp;Different calculations can have slightly different factors. &nbsp;Let us now go through these factors individually, and then multiply them to ogether to estimate the number of intelligent civilizations in the Galaxy today.&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>N* = Number of stars in the galaxy. </strong> Current measurement of the size, rotation and luminosity of our Milky Way Galaxy gives a mass in stars (excluding the Galaxy's Dark Matter) around 300 billion M<sub>o</sub> (3 x 10<sup>11</sup> solar masses). Since the most common star has M~0.3 M<sub>o</sub>, we estimate there are a trillion (1 x 10<sup>12</sup>) stars in the Milky Way.</li>
	<li><strong>fp&nbsp;= Fraction of these stars that can host habitable planets.</strong> High mass stars (OBAF) may evolve so fast that intelligent life does not have the time to develop; but these stars are rare. &nbsp;Binary systems with 0.1-100AU separations will not permit stable orbits; this eliminates some stars. &nbsp;But the very recent census of exoplanets, discussed two weeks ago, directly demonstrates that the majority of stars -- not only can -- but actually do contain planets that orbit inside, within, and outside the habitable zone. &nbsp;So, I think that a&nbsp;reasonable estimate today is fp~0.7&nbsp;-- very high compared to earlier discussions of the Drake Equation. &nbsp;(The current authors of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_equation">Wikipedia</a>, for example, are more cautious but still put this at fraction at 0.2-0.5.) &nbsp;Until recently, many astronomers considered this fraction to be lower (maybe 0.05), but it has recently be recognized that the very common&nbsp;low-mass M stars have good Habitable Zones close to the star. &nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
	<li><strong>N<sub>p</sub>&nbsp;= number of planets per star </strong>. Our own solar system has ~8 planets. &nbsp;Using radial velocity techniques,&nbsp;Penn State Professor Jason Wright has estimated that at least 28% of stars that have one planet also have additional planets. &nbsp;See his <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2009ApJ...693.1084W">2009 paper</a>. &nbsp;&nbsp;Using planetary transit techniques, the Kepler mission has found roughly 10% of stars with one planet also have additional planets. &nbsp;But in both cases other planets could be present and still be undetected today. &nbsp;Planet formation calculations (e.g. oligarchic growth of planetary embryos) suggest that a number of widely-spaced planets is a common and stable configuration. &nbsp;My estimate, based on the data and planet formation&nbsp;theory&nbsp;is again optimistic:&nbsp; N<sub>p</sub>~5.</li>
	<li><strong>f<sub>e</sub>&nbsp;= Fraction of these planets with Earth-like conditions suitable for life.</strong> This restricts planets of interest to those with nearly-circular orbits in the habitable zone where water is liquid. &nbsp;Planetary mass and atmospheric composition play an important role in habitability, e.g. through the carbonate-silicate cycle (Scharf's text, sec 9.3).&nbsp; In our own system, 1-2 out of 8 planets are suitable for life for extended periods (say, >1 Gyr, Gyr = giga year = billion years). &nbsp;this includes Earth and Mars, because Mars was habitable 1-2 GYy ago when water flowed in rivers and oceans.&nbsp;&nbsp;A few of the extrasolar planets fall within the Habitable Zone, though often with eccentric orbits. &nbsp;The recent estimates based on Kepler mission data by <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1103.1443">Catanzarite & Shao</a> and by <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1109.4682">Traub</a> suggest&nbsp;f<sub>e</sub>~0.03-0.3. &nbsp;Again this is a very high fraction. &nbsp;</li>
	<li><strong>f<sub>l</sub>&nbsp;= Fraction of suitable planets where life actually develops </strong> Miller-Urey experiments show&nbsp; that biotic material (e.g.. amino acids, lipids) can arise in an environment like the early Earth. &nbsp;Simple biotic material may also be brought in by infalling interstellar particles or comets. Life may take a wide variety of forms from sulfur metabolizing, deep-sea vent bacteria to oxygen-breathing animals. &nbsp;Nonetheless, there has been no success in producing self-reproducing macromolecular systems in the laboratory. So the mechanism of life formation is still unknown and the probability of it happening in a limited time or location is very small. &nbsp;The integrated probability over a Gyr and over an entire planet is unknown. &nbsp;Let's say the chance is at least one-in-a-thousand habitable planets give rise to life,&nbsp;f<sub>l</sub>~10<sup>-3</sup>-10<sup>0</sup>.</li>
	<li><strong>f<sub>i</sub>&nbsp;= Our definition of an intelligent civilization is one that is able to communicate using radio telescopes.</strong> It took ~4 Gyr for simple cyanobacteria to evolve into radio astronomers.&nbsp; Asteroidal impacts (such as the one that killed the dinosaurs) or climatic changes (like the changes that dried up Mars) are two possibilities. It is also possible that an intelligent species might emerge but be unable or unwilling to communicate, e.g.&nbsp; life on water or gas worlds. &nbsp;This quantity is entirely unknown. &nbsp;Let's say again at least on-in-a-thousand but no more than 10% of lifeforms develop radio telescopes: &nbsp;f<sub>i</sub>=10<sup>-3</sup>-10<sup>-1</sup>.</li>
	<li><strong>L/L<sub>MW</sub>&nbsp;= Lifetime of communicating civilization / Lifetime of Milky Way.</strong> The lifetime of the Milky Way is ~11 Gyr (1x10<sup>11</sup>&nbsp;yr). Our radio telescopes have been in existence only tens-of-years (10<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;yr)&nbsp;and all human culture with written languages are 10<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;yr old. &nbsp;What does the future hold? &nbsp;Civilizations can be destroyed by nuclear or biological war, environmental or technological disaster, &nbsp;asteroidal impact or some other catastrophe. It is also possible that civilizations have the ability to build radio telescope, but choose not to. &nbsp;Let's guess L/L<sub>MW</sub>~10<sup>-7</sup>-10<sup>-3</sup>.</li>
</ul>

<center>
	<p><strong>N<sub>i&nbsp;</sub>&nbsp;= (1x10<sup>12</sup>)<sub>*</sub>&nbsp;x 0.7<sub>p&nbsp;</sub>x 5<sub>p</sub>&nbsp;x (0.03-0.3)<sub>e</sub>&nbsp;x (10<sup>-3</sup>-10<sup>0</sup>)<sub>l&nbsp;</sub>x (10<sup>-3</sup>-10<sup>-1</sup>)&nbsp;<sub>i&nbsp;</sub>x (10<sup>-7</sup>-10<sup>-3</sup>) </strong></p>
</center>

<p>Multiplying these factors give a range of to 1x10<sup>-2</sup>&nbsp;to 1x10<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;intelligent civilizations in the Galaxy today.&nbsp;The minimum of 3x10<sup>-3</sup>&nbsp;intelligent civilizations in the Galaxy today seems too low. &nbsp;Since we have radio telescopes, the number is at least 1 = 10<sup>0</sup>. &nbsp;</p>

<p>So it is reasonable to consider that there are between one (we are alone in the Galaxy) to a hundred million (10<sup>8</sup>) intelligent civilizations in the Galaxy today. &nbsp;For convenience, let us choose <strong>N<sub>i</sub>~10<sup>3</sup></strong>, understanding that it could be a thousand times higher or lower. Most of the uncertainty involves the biological and sociological aspects of the Drake Equation (last three factors), not the astronomical aspects (first four aspects). &nbsp;</p>

<h2>How Far Away is the Nearest Intelligent Civilization?</h2>

<p>We can use our answer to estimate if communication with other intelligent civilizations is practical by asking: What is the average distance between civilizations for a given N<sub>i</sub>? &nbsp;Consider that most stars lie in the Galactic disk (the Galactic halo has fewer stars and these have lower metallicities, so plausibly fewer planets). The Milky Way disk is roughly a cylinder with volume:</p>

<center>
	<p>2 pi R<sup>2</sup> x h ~ 2 pi (100,000 ly)<sup>2</sup> 1,500 ly ~&nbsp; 1 x 10<sup>14</sup>&nbsp;ly<sup>3</sup> (cubic light years)&nbsp;</p>

	<p style="text-align: left; ">The density of civilizations is the number per unit volume, or <strong>N<sub>i</sub></strong> / (1 X 10<sup>14</sup>) civilizations per cubic light year. &nbsp;Since volumes have units of (distance)<sup>3</sup>, and the density has units of (distance)<sup>-3</sup>, &nbsp;the typical distance between civilizations (if they are randomly distributed in the Galactic disk) is d = 1/ (Density)<sup>1/3</sup>. &nbsp;So, if N<sub>i</sub>=10<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;and Volume=10<sup>14</sup> lightyears, the density is 10<sup>-11</sup> ly<sup>-3</sup> and the average distance between civilizations is d ~ 5,000 ly. &nbsp;This is about 2 kpc (kiloparsecs) using the units familiar to astronomers. &nbsp;&nbsp;For a more optimistic estimate of <strong>N<sub>i</sub></strong>=1,000,000, d ~ 500 ly = 200 pc.</p>
</center>

<p>The distance in light years is the time it takes to send a message in years. Twice this number is the time to send a message and get a reply (plus a bit for the message recipient to think of a response and prepare the radio telescope).&nbsp; <strong>So, for middle values of N<sub>i</sub> in the Drake Equation, a typical conversation takes thousands of years to occur. </strong>&nbsp;That's very long on himan timescales! &nbsp;If the first pharaohs of ancient Egypt had our advanced telescope technology and sent a message to the nearest civilization (assuming they knew which star had the right inhabited planet with radio telescopes), we would only now be receiving the first response. Thus, except for very optimistic values of <strong>N<sub>i</sub></strong>, optimistic values, meaningful conversations between civilizations are not really viable because the time to send/receive a message is longer than the duration of a civilization.</p>
