<p>For 150 years, a debate has waged concerning the implications of&nbsp;<b>Charles Darwin's&nbsp;<i>Origin of Species</i></b>(1859) for the Judeo-Christian belief that God created humankind as described in the&nbsp;<b><i>Book of Genesis</i></b>.&nbsp; William Paley (<i>Natural Theology</i>, 1802) argued that order (e.g. complex organisms) cannot arise from disorder (e.g. simpler organisms) and that Creator is required.&nbsp; But Darwin's mechanisms of natural selection, as elucidated and confirmed by modern biology (mutation, sexual recombination, genetic mixing, species radiation, etc.), contradicts this claim.&nbsp; It describes in great detail the development of complex life from simpler life.&nbsp; Biochemical DNA-based life provides a continuous disequilibrium which, when interacting with complex and changing ecosystems, leads to the emergence of more complex species and the elimination of unfitindividuals.&nbsp; However, the biochemical evidence does not clearly explain the emergence of the&nbsp;<i>first</i>&nbsp;lifeform.</p>
<p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Times; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "><font color="#000000">The debate wages on in the public arena: a recent poll in the U.S. indicates only 44% agree that humans descended from earlier lifeforms, and a law suit was recently argued in a Pennsylvania Federal court whether or not a statement regarding Intelligent Design should be included in a public school scence class. &nbsp;(The judge ruled against Intelligent Design and in favor of modern biology.) &nbsp;Many important church councils have formally stated that evolution is not a threat to belief in God (e.g.<i>Humani Generis</i>&nbsp;issued by Pope Pius XII 1950).&nbsp; Some Christian scholars, often labeled&nbsp;<b>Creation Scientists&nbsp;</b>in the 1980s, argued for the&nbsp;<b>Young Earth hypothesis</b>&nbsp;-- that the world was formed in six days in 4004 BC as literally told in the Bible.&nbsp; However, the vast majority of scientists believe the Young Earth hypothesis blatantly disagrees with a wealth of scientific results from biology, geology&nbsp; and astronomy.</font></p>

<blockquote style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Times; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "><font color="#000000">"We have the biblical concept of a six-day creation, we have the concept of evolution over thousands of millions of years, and we have a number of views intermediate between the two.&nbsp; Which is true?&nbsp; Science is the best system devised by man to give us information about nature.&nbsp; However, the conclusions of science are not final.&nbsp; Science repeatedly revises and even reverses its conclusions ... [especially when dealing with a past that] cannot be experimentally repeated.&nbsp;&nbsp; When it comes to answering the great questions of origins, meaning, and destiny, science has lost its credentials.&nbsp; This happened over a century ago when science decided to exclude God from its explanatory menu.&nbsp; ... The Bible, on the other hand, takes a more open approach, inviting us to consider nature as well as God ... As such it has a broader base for addressing the questions or origins... Its internal consistency challenges any suggestion that it is a collection of invented stories.&nbsp; This is not a book that we can easily dismiss. "&nbsp; Ariel A. Roth in&nbsp;<i>In Six Days: Why Fifty Scientists Choose to Believe in Creation</i>2000</font></blockquote>

<p>Some Creationists point to complex biological structures like the human eye, arguing that such an amazing organ could never develop through random evolutionary processes, and requires instead divine creation. &nbsp;But detailed study of the evolution of the eye, from bacteria to primates, shows a long sequence of evolutionary changes. &nbsp;Indeed, the human eye is not the best for many purposes. &nbsp;You can hear some of this argument on YouTube: a 5-minute excerpt from Neil Degrasse Tyson's&nbsp;<em>Cosmos</em>&nbsp;television series <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SXHMm5I-68" target="_blank">here</a>, and a longer 45-minute presentation by several scientists <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnAAcr-26NA" target="_blank">here</a>. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000000">During the 1990s, a more moderate viewpoint known as&nbsp;<b>Intelligent Design&nbsp;</b>was developed by scholars who are both well-schooled in science and in religion.&nbsp; They generally accept major portions of Darwinian evolution and astronomy; e.g. that the Earth is billions of years old, that 99% of species are now extinct, that all species were not in the Garden of Eden, and that genetic variations (e.g. poodles vs. Labrador dogs) can arise from natural selection.&nbsp; But they assert that whole species cannot be descended from one another, and that the origin of life cannot have arisen from inorganic chemicals.&nbsp; They argue that life itself is `irreducibly complex' and requires an intelligent creator, and that nature is fundamentally subordinate to God.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">Biologists argue that even the emergence of first life can plausibly be explained by natural causes and effects: while any one molecular structure is unlikely to transform itself into a specific other structure, real evolutionary change occurs in huge populations under diverse circumstances (Robert Pennock&nbsp;<i>Tower of Babel: The Evidence Against the New Creationism&nbsp;</i>1999).&nbsp; For example, the rapid emergence of bacteria resistent to antibiotics does not require Intelligent Design.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some scientists argue strongly against the intellectual merits of Intelligent Design; here is one who avows a rational ecological ethic:</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">Some leaders argue that science and religion can coexist by confining their scope and avoiding the claim that a single framework explains all aspects of human existence.&nbsp; Stephen Jay Gould, one of the foremost Darwinian scholars, said that science and religion are&nbsp;<b>non-overlapping magisteria</b>&nbsp;equally valuable for investigations of nature and for the pursuit of spiritual values, respectively.</font></p>

<p>The professional scientific community is unanimous in its rejection of blurring the distinction between a scientific and religious approach to understanding evolution.&nbsp; Here is the 2005 statement of the American Astronomical Society:&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Times; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; ">The American Astronomical Society supports teaching evolution in our nation’s K-12 science classes. Evolution is a valid scientific theory for the origin of species that has been repeatedly tested and verified through observation, formulation of testable statements to explain those observations, and controlled experiments or additional observations to find out whether these ideas are right or wrong. A scientific theory is not speculation or a guess -- scientific theories are unifying concepts that explain the physical universe.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Times; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;">"Astronomical observations show that the Universe is many billions of years old (see the AAS publication,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.aas.org/education/ancientuniverse.html" target="_blank">An Ancient Universe</a>), that nuclear reactions in stars have produced the chemical elements over time, and recent observations show that gravity has led to the formation of many planets in our Galaxy. The early history of the solar system is being explored by astronomical observation and by direct visits to solar system objects. Fossils, radiological measurements, and changes in DNA trace the growth of the tree of life on Earth. The theory of evolution, like the theories of gravity, plate tectonics, and Big Bang cosmology, explains, unifies, and predicts natural phenomena. Scientific theories provide a proven framework for improving our understanding of the world.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Times; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; ">In recent years, advocates of “Intelligent Design,” have proposed teaching “Intelligent Design” as a valid alternative theory for the history of life. Although scientists have vigorous discussions on interpretations for some aspects of evolution, there is widespread agreement on the power of natural selection to shape the emergence of new species. Even if there were no such agreement, “Intelligent Design” fails to meet the basic definition of a scientific idea: its proponents do not present&nbsp;<em>testable</em>hypotheses and do not provide evidence for their views that can be verified or duplicated by subsequent researchers<strong>.</strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Times; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; ">Since “Intelligent Design” is not science, it does not belong in the science curriculum of the nation’s primary and secondary schools.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Times; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; ">The AAS supports the positions taken by the National Academy of Sciences, the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the National Science Teachers’ Association, the American Geophysical Union, the American Chemical Society, and the American Association of Physics Teachers on the teaching of evolution. The AAS also supports the National Science Education Standards: they emphasize the importance of scientific methods as well as articulating well-established scientific theories.</p>
