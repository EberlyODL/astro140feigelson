<p><em>Having found protoplanetary disks orbiting virtually all young stars, we now have to figure out how planets form in these disks. &nbsp;Planet formation is still incompletely understood ... many physical processes seem to be involved, and astrophysicists are struggling today to put them all together in a coherent fashion. &nbsp;Much insight, however, is obtained by studying ancient bodies in our Solar System. &nbsp;Earth and the other planets have erased their origins, but the small rocky bodies from the Asteroid Belt, a few of which have landed on Earth as meteorites, provide essential clues. &nbsp;So we model the origin of our own Solar System, and adapt that model to explain exoplanetary systems.</em></p>

In the early stages, the merging is caused by sticking; this sticking probably most effective in the cooler parts of the disk outside the&nbsp;<strong>snow line</strong>&nbsp;(T=273C where water freezes). When the bodies become sufficient large (roughly kilometer size), then gravitational focusing becomes important. &nbsp;The&nbsp;larger planetisimals grow faster, sweeping all of the rock in a ring around the Sun. After tens of millions of years, only a few large, well-separated protoplanets are left. &nbsp;Other small bodies are scattered to outer eccentric orbits, as we see today in the Kuiper Belt and Oort Cloud where most comets reside.&nbsp; The few very largest bodies attract hydrogen and other gas â€¦ these become the giant gas planets like Jupiter. &nbsp;Others remain rocky like Earth and Mars, with a bit of atmosphere from the volatile molecules (like water, methane, ammonia, and carbon dioxide) that was originally in the interstellar dust. &nbsp;This planet formation scenario is called the&nbsp;<strong>core accretion model. &nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
