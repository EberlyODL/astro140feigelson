<p>Once formed in a molecular cloud, the individual star goes through four major phases of evolution:</p>
<ul><li>a brief <strong>pre-main sequence</strong>&nbsp;phase powered by release of energy from the gravitational collapse;</li><li>a long-lived <strong>main sequence</strong> phase powered by fusion of hydrogen to helium in the core;</li><li>the <strong>red giant phase</strong>&nbsp;powered by fusion of helium to elements up to iron;</li><li>death processes—the outer layers of the red giant stars are ejected, slowly or violently, and the inner core becomes one of three types of compact star (<strong>white dwarf</strong>, <strong>neutron star</strong>&nbsp;or <strong>black hole</strong>).</li></ul>
<p>The observational evidence for the evolution of a star is often shown on the Hertzsprung-Russell (H-R) diagram. Here we plot the luminosity of the star on the vertical axis (actually, the log of the luminosity since the range of luminosities is so huge), and the surface temperature on the horizontal axis. Recall that <strong>luminosity</strong>&nbsp;has units of energy per second, and measures the intrinsic light output or "power" of a star. A common unit of luminosity is the `watt'; we might have a 60-watt lightbulb in our room, while the Sun today emits 4x10<sup>27</sup> watts. &nbsp;We designate one solar luminosity as 1 L<sub>o</sub>. &nbsp;Below is the best available HR diagram, obtained with the Hipparcos satellite a decade ago. &nbsp;</p>

<p>A protostar in a molecular cloud has a relatively cool surface but is quite luminous, and thus appears in the upper-right part of the H-R diagram. It quickly (not too quickly… for a 1 M<sub>o</sub> star like the Sun, in ~10 million years) loses power but heats its surface, moving downward and to the left on the diagram below.</p>

<p>When the star reaches the main sequence where the core temperature exceeds ~13 million degrees Kelvin, nuclear reactions begin in the core that fuse hydrogen to helium. In most stars, this is through the "proton-proton chain" with intermediary steps involving rare isotopes of hydrogen and helium. As over 70% of the star is hydrogen, there is a vast supply of fuel for this reaction, keeping stars on the main sequence for (in most cases) billions of years. This is the most stable and long-lived phase of stellar evolution. Our Sun today has been on the main sequence for 4.5 billion years, and will continue hydrogen-to-helium burning steadily for ~6 billion years more. Below is an artist's conception of the interior of the Sun and many other similar main sequence stars. &nbsp;</p>
