<p>We have established quite a lot about the possibilities of extraterrestrial life:</p>
<ul><li>Most stars are born with protoplanetary disks, many of these produce planetary systems (e.g. the extrasolar planets found from Doppler wobble and transits), and some of these quite reasonably produce planets in the habitable zone (i.e. liquid water).&nbsp;</li><li>The molecular clouds and protoplanetary disks have molecules that lie at the foundation of terrestrial life: H<sub>2</sub>O, CO<sub>2</sub>, and a variety of small carbon based molecules (e.g. acids, alcohols, hydrocarbons)</li><li>The biochemistry of terrestrial life constructs carbon-based macromolecules from these ingredients (cellulose, proteins, DNA) from which a remarkable variety of organisms living in a wide range of environments (extremophiles in ocean vents, hot volcanic springs, in rock, in ice) have developed (archaea, bacteria, fleas, chimpanzees and humans).&nbsp;</li><li>The formation of the first life forms on Earth -- the leap from small molecules to self-reproducing macromolecules -- is not yet understood. &nbsp;But the evolution of increasingly complex and diverse life forms from simpler ones is well-understood.&nbsp;</li><li>A wide diversity of sophisticated lifeforms exists on Earth, but there is no advanced life elsewhere in the Solar System, although there is a possibility of primitive (e.g. archaea-type) life on Mars or Jovian moons such as Europa & Titan. &nbsp;</li><li>In the past half-century, humans have demonstrated the ability to send robotic probes throughout the Solar System, though not to other stars. &nbsp;These probes undoubtedly have terrestrial microbes, and thus conceivably could bring terrestrial life to other worlds. &nbsp;</li></ul>
<p><br>Based on these findings, during Theme V of the course, we ask questions like:</p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><ul><li>What are the possibilities of <span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">intelligent</span><span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span>life on habitable planets orbiting other stars?</li><li>What are the possibilities of us <u><strong>communicating</strong></u> with them (or vice versa) using light?</li><li>What are the possibilities of us <u><strong>traveling</strong></u> to them (or vice versa) using space ships?</li><li>Has such interstellar travel <strong><u>yet occurred</u></strong>?&nbsp; Can we become a space-faring civilization? Have we been visited by aliens?</li><li>Can there be a <strong><u>Galaxy-wide civilization</u></strong> with closely linked societies on many habitable planets?</li><li>What is the&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold; ">meaning and context</span>&nbsp;of life in the Universe, both from a cultural viewpoint and from a modern cosmological viewpoint? &nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul></div>
