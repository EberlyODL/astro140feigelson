<p>To pursue our study of live in the universe, we first need to introduce some concepts and information about atoms, molecules and light. `Atoms' are tiny entities with a dense nucleus of protons and neutrons surrounded by a cloud of electrons. The number of protons defines the element: 1 = hydrogen, 2 = helium, …, 6 = carbon, 7 = nitrogen, 8 = oxygen, …, 26 = iron, and so on. A collection of atoms can be called a gas cloud.</p>

<p>When the cloud is hot, two atoms that collide will bounce off each other because the electron clouds (both negatively charges) repel each other. But when a cloud is cold and the collisions are slow and the two atoms can form a weak, but stable, bond. This occurs when the attraction of the protons is slightly stronger than the repulsion of the electrons. These entity of two or more atoms bonded together is called a `molecule'. `Chemistry' is the science devoted to the behavior and reactions between molecules.</p>

<p>The bonds between atoms in a molecule are not entirely fixed. They can stretch and bend in various ways (see fun <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_vibration">moving diagrams</a>). Even at very cold temperatures, the molecules can rotate. But the behavior of atoms and molecules is not like the behavior of large objects we experience in our daily lives. Large objects can move in a smooth fashion where any energy is possible. But tiny objects follow the rules of `quantum mechanics' and can be in only a fixed number of distinct energy states. A rotating or vibrating molecule can change its energy state by emitting or absorbing a particular wavelength of light. These wavelengths are generally not in the visible band, but have longer wavelengths in the infrared and microwave bands.</p>

<p>Thus, astronomers can observe the sky using specialized telescopes and look for emission or absorption lines at particular wavelengths associated with the quantum transitions of specific molecules. Even for simple molecules, these patterns of spectral lines can be very complicated, often blurring together to form messy bands. But they are unique for each molecule: just as a crime investigator can identify a person from a unique fingerprint, an astronomer can identify a molecule from its unique pattern of microwave and infrared emission lines. The study of the spectral lines and patterns produced by different molecules is called `molecular spectroscopy'.</p>

<p>Here are infrared spectra for three common molecules: water, carbon dioxide, and ethanol (the alcohol in wine and beer). To show why this is relevant to our search for live in the universe, we show the infrared spectra of three familiar planets in our Solar System. We see that Venus, Earth and Mars all have carbon dioxide in their atmospheres, but only Earth has abundant water and oxygen (inferred from it chemical byproduct, O<sub>3</sub> or ozone).</p>

<p>To discover the molecular material from which planets (and eventually living organisms) form, we have to study the sky with infrared and microwave telescopes. Below are photos of important telescopes at the three bands: the Gemini telescope on a Hawaiian mountaintop for visible wavelengths, the Spitzer Space Telescope orbiting the Earth at infrared wavelengths (two photos), and the ALMA (Atacama Large Millimeter Array) now being built on a mountaintop in Chile.</p>
