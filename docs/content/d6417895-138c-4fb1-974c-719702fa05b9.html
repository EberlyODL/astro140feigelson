<h3>Chemical foundations of life</h3>
<p>All known living organisms on Earth are based on <strong><b style="color: rgb(153, 0, 0);">organic (carbon-based) molecules</b> </strong>: chains and rings of carbon atoms with H, O, N and occasional other elements. These are often combinations and polymers of simple molecules found in the Galaxy's interstellar gas and dust, which entered into the solar nebula and are now found in the atmospheres and ices around the Solar System. Examples:</p>
<ul><li>CH<sub>4</sub> (methane). Chains of methane give propane, octane (gasoline), wax and other <strong>hydrocarbons</strong>&nbsp;with H and C atoms.&nbsp;&nbsp;Add carbon rings to get soot and coal.</li><li>Chain of 5 CH<sub>4</sub> + 6 H<sub>2</sub>O + CO<sub>2</sub> = C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub>, a common <strong><b style="color: rgb(153, 0, 0);">sugar</b></strong> produced by photosynthesis (Fig 1.5). Chains of sugar give starch, chitin and <strong><span class="textbook_color1"><b style="color: rgb(153, 0, 0);">cellulose</b></span></strong>; the latter is the principal structural molecule of plants (e.g. the wood of trees). These are <strong>carbohydrates</strong>&nbsp;with H, C and O atoms.&nbsp;</li><li>Chain of 3 CH<sub>4</sub> + 1 H<sub>2</sub>O + 1 CO<sub>2</sub> + 1 NH<sub>3</sub> = C<sub>4</sub>O<sub>3</sub>H<sub>6</sub>N gives alanine, one of ~20 common <strong><b style="color: rgb(153, 0, 0);">amino acids (Fig 1.6)</b></strong>. Chains of amino acids give <strong><b style="color: rgb(153, 0, 0);">proteins</b></strong>&nbsp;which are principal structural and functional molecules in all living organisms on Earth.</li><li>Ring of 4 CH<sub>4</sub>, 2 NH<sub>3</sub>, 1 H<sub>2</sub>O and 1 CO<sub>2</sub> gives nucleic acid thymine (Fig 1.8). Huge polymers of sugars, nucleic acids and PO<sub>4</sub> molecules gives deoxyribonucleic acid or <b style="color: rgb(153, 0, 0);">DNA</b> (Fig 1.9), the principal self-reproducing molecule containing the genetic code in living organisms.</li></ul>
<p><strong><b>Terrestrial life is thus based on macromolecules (cellulose, proteins, DNA, etc.).&nbsp; Carbon is the crucial element for all known Earth-life. &nbsp;All known Earth-organisms require liquid&nbsp;water as a solvent for at least some life stage. &nbsp;The&nbsp;huge, complicated molecules of terrestrial life are themselves based on simple molecules, which&nbsp;&nbsp;can found distributed throughout the Milky Way&nbsp;galaxy .</b></strong></p>

<h3>Chemistry of the Galaxy</h3>
<p><em><strong>It may be useful to&nbsp;review our earlier class on <a href="https://courses.ed.science.psu.edu/astro140/node/497">molecules in the interstellar medium</a>. &nbsp;</strong></em>We found that there are dozens of known organic (carbon-based) molecular species identified in interstellar clouds. &nbsp;Many are also found in protoplanetary disks where planets form. &nbsp;Our text's Table 1.3 also gives a list. &nbsp;Note that these are not exactly the same molecules that lie at the foundation of life on Earth (e.g. sugars, amino acids, bases), but they are closely related. &nbsp;Thus, the Galaxy provides a rich mixture of organic molecules from which life can form .... if conditions are right!</p>

<h3>Origin of life on Earth</h3>
<p>The first clear cut examples of living organisms appearing in fossils is ~3.5 billion years ago, or ~1 billion years after Earth formed. &nbsp;There is a debate among paleontologists ... some are convinced by evidence that living organisms were present as early as 0.5 billion years after Earth's formation (sec 2.4.5). &nbsp; These are simple unicellular bacteria and algae which grew in mats on the surface of the ancient ocean. &nbsp;The evidence for them are fossil structures called&nbsp;<b><span style="color: rgb(153, 0, 0);">stramatolites</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>seen in ancient rockbeds (Fig. 2.16). &nbsp;<br><br>We do not know exactly how the first self-reproducing living system formed. &nbsp;<b style="color: rgb(153, 0, 0);">Laboratory experiments by Miller & Urey</b> starting in the 1950s show that amino acids and other fundamental organic molecules of living organisms can form from mixtures of H<sub>2</sub>O, CO<sub>2</sub>, CH<sub>4</sub> and NH<sub>3</sub> plus solar energy and soils (Fig 1.19). &nbsp;Other early experiments have taken amino acids and lipids in the laboratory and made cell-like spheres (Fig 1.30). &nbsp;</p>
<p><em><strong>However, no self-reproducing molecule or cell has been formed in the laboratory.</strong></em>&nbsp; We can only guess that somewhere on the Earth's complex surface, over hundreds of millions of years, a complicated molecular system based on left-handed amino acids emerged, began eating other organic molecules, and began reproducing. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>In the 19th century, Charles Darwin suggested life formed in a `warm little pond'. &nbsp;It is plausible that the early Earth's seas concentrated organic molecules in drying pools or ponds &nbsp;(sec 1.6.3). &nbsp;And the chemistry in such shallow ponds can be accelerated by catalysis with certain minerals (sec 1.7.3). &nbsp;Nonetheless, many attempts to reproduce the formation of complex polymers in simulated ponds, as we see in living organisms, &nbsp;have failed. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Some discussions of life on Earth, often motivated by ancient religious texts that describe the creation of life by a deity, conclude from this failure that the generation of self-reproducing chemical systems from naturally occuring chemicals is impossible. &nbsp;Most scientists argue that the failure of laboratory experiments so far does not mean that ... over vast range of conditions and millions of years ... that it did not succeed on the early Earth. &nbsp;However,&nbsp;the expression "Absence of evidence does not imply evidence of absence" applies to such situation. &nbsp;</p>
<p>While the basic idea of Miller-Urey-like experiments is foundational, the details of&nbsp;these experiments were subsequently criticized for using gas atmospheres that are unlikely to be representative of the early Earth's atmospheres. &nbsp;Even more recently, there has been renewed debate about the early Earth's atmosphere, so this laboratory work is far from conclusive. &nbsp;Further complicating matters, recent advances in gene sequencing has tried to&nbsp;identify a last universal common ancestor (LUCA). &nbsp; &nbsp;While we don't have a definitive LUCA, several lines of evidence point towards genomes most similar to organisms&nbsp;currently living deep in the ocean near hydrothermal vents. &nbsp;If life on Earth originated in such an enviroment, then the Miller-Urey experiments are still interesting scientifically, but may be totally unrelated to the origin of life on Earth.</p>
<p>In summary, the origin of life on Earth remains incompletely explained. &nbsp;The ingredients of simple organic molecules are widespread in the galaxy, and are now being studied in protoplanetary disks where planets form (using the new ALMA telescope in Chile). &nbsp;Organic molecules like amino acids were definitely present in our Sun's protoplanetary disk, as evidenced by the rich organic chemicals found in <em><strong>carbonaceous chondrites,&nbsp;</strong></em>certain rare meteorites from the Asteroid Belt that have landed on Earth (sec 1.5.3 and Table 1.5). &nbsp;But we don't know how the first self-reproducing molecular system emerged. &nbsp; But once the first RNA-type self-reproducing system did appear, then the development of a wide variety of living organisms comparatively easy to explain based on natural selection. &nbsp;We treat the evolution of life on Earth in the next class. &nbsp;</p>
