<h2>Important stages of evolution of life on Earth</h2>
<ul><li>Development of the first self-reproducing molecular systems, potentially based on RNA or another self-catalyzing information-carrying molecule. &nbsp;A model of&nbsp;<em><strong>RNA world</strong></em> is outlined in sec 1.8.1. &nbsp;</li><li>Development from a variety of primitive bacteria now seen in marshes, hot springs, caves and deep ocean vents. Probably ~3.8 Gyr ago.&nbsp; Below are photos of ancient forms of life before photosynthesis arose that exist today around deep ocean vents (Fig 1.36) and in boiling hot springs in volcanic zones (Fig 2.27).</li><li>Development of photosynthetic bacteria and algae (e.g. <a href="http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/bacteria/cyanointro.html" target="_blank">cyanobacteria</a> which may have made the stramatolites) producing the oxygen-rich atmosphere. &nbsp;3.0-2.5 GYr ago</li><li>Development of a more complex biochemical system seen in most cells today (eukaryotes, mitochondria). 1.2 Gyr ago</li><li>Development of simple animals (Precambrian era, 0.6 Gyr ago) including fishes (0.4 Gyr ago), insects & dinosaurs (0.25 Gyr ago), mammals (0.065 Gyr ago), primates (0.005 Gyr ago), hominids (~0.003 Gyr ago) and the hypothetical most-recent common human ancestors&nbsp;to all humans today (~0.0002 Gyr ago).</li></ul>
<p>Most species that have lived on Earth are now extinct (see <font color="#330033"><a href="http://tolweb.org/tree/" target="_blank">Tree of life</a> </font> for many examples). The processes of the evolution of life, proposed in the 19th century by Charles Darwin, are well-established. In particular, recent projects to determine the sequence of the DNA genetic codes of different organisms shows without doubt that all life forms on Earth, including humans, are related to each other. &nbsp;</p>

<h3>Example of Evolution:&nbsp; Origin and Diversification of Birds on Isolated Islands</h3>
<p>Charles Darwin, the originator of modern theory of evolution, derived many of his ideas by studying the variety of animals on the isolated Galapagos Islands off the Pacific coast of South America. His analysis was based mainly on the easily seen characteristics like the structure of bird beaks.&nbsp; Darwin did not know the underlying mechanisms for genetic transmission and diversification; this did not emerge until the 1950's when James Watson and Francis Crick used X-ray crystallography taken by&nbsp;Rosalind Franklin to&nbsp;unravel&nbsp;the structure and genetic code of DNA molecules. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Today, Darwin's basic idea&nbsp;has been superbly validated by studied of the genetic code. &nbsp;Above are results from a 2011 statistical analysis of sequences of >20,000 DNA nucleic acid bases for Hawaiian birds (bottom) compared to common birds on large continents (middle and top).&nbsp; The left-hand&nbsp; `phylogenic tree' is based on mitochondrial DNA while the (very similar) right-hand tree is based on nuclear DNA.&nbsp; The Hawaiian birds are found to be closely related to Asian finches, and only distantly related to other birds like the sparrow.&nbsp; Combining mutation rates with other data, the biologists can trace the progression of the Asian finches from the western Hawaiian islands (~5 million years ago) to the eastern Big Island (<1 million years ago).&nbsp; See a <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/science/punctuated-equilibrium/2011/nov/02/hawaiian-honeycreepers-tangled-evolutionary-tree" target="_blank">news report</a> on these findings. &nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center; "><i><strong>Life of Earth is incredibly rich and complex: there have been millions of species adapting to an incredible range of conditions. &nbsp; A few of these species have astonishing intelligence, including us humans. &nbsp;Yet all organisms share the same biochemical machinery (DNA, proteins, cells, etc.) and have closely intertwined genetic codes. &nbsp;Despite the diversity of species, life on Earth is cohesive ... we, our puppy, the tree, the fruit fly and nasty bacteria are all cousins. &nbsp;</strong></i></p>
