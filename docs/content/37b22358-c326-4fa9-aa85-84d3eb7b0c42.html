<p>Earth and Mars orbit the Sun within the `Habitable Zone' where liquid water can potentially be present on the surface, depending on the atmospheric pressure and composition (and the presence of sufficient water). We therefore focus on the properties of these two planets and review the properties of Venus and Mercury only to contrast the conditions for planets too close to their star to be habitable. &nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Earth's interior </strong>is still mostly molten from its formation 4.5 billion years ago. The solid crust of light silicates is very thin: only 5-50 km (vs. total radius of 6400 km). Under the thin crust is a thick mantle of melted silicates, a liquid outer core, and an inner core of solid iron/nickel.</p>
<p>Earth's surface features are explained by<em><b>&nbsp;plate tectonics</b></em>. First introduced by Alfred Wegener in the 1930s and largely disparaged at the time, it is now completely confirmed by GPS and radio astronomical measurements of continental motions. The Earth's surface is broken into ~20&nbsp;<b><em>crustal plates</em></b>, which are moved in different directions by convection currents in the mantle. New crust forms by uplift and spreading of mantle material at mid-oceanic ridges, with the newest rock along the ridge line. Old crust is either&nbsp;<em><b>subducted</b>&nbsp;</em>into the mantle along a trench, or is crumpled upward into mountain ranges (e.g. the Himalaya Mountains being produced today as the Indian plate crashes into the Asian plate). Plate motions and subduction are violent processes and produce&nbsp;<i><b>volcanoes</b></i>, mountain ranges and<b>&nbsp;<i>earthquakes</i></b>&nbsp;along plate boundaries.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px; "><img alt="" src="https://courses.ed.science.psu.edu/_legacy/astro140/Tectonic_plate_boundaries_clean.png" style="width: 775px; height: 429px; "></p>
<p>Typical plate motions are 1-5 cm per year, roughly the rate at which fingernails grow, amounting to roughly 10<sup>3&nbsp;</sup>kilometers every 10<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;years. The diagrams below are two representations of convection from the mantle and its effects on the surface tectonic plates.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Earth's active plate tectonics serve a key role in the "carbon cycle" that helps maintain the carbon dioxide concentration of Earth's atmosphere.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Earth's crustal motions today:</p>
<ul><li>Atlantic Ocean is widening, separating South America from Africa and North America from Europe. &nbsp;North American & Europe have collided repeatedly in the past. The Appalachian Mountains around us now are from 2 collisions ago -- &nbsp;its counterparts on the other side are the Scottish highlands and Atlas Mountains in Morocco.&nbsp;</li><li>Australia and India are pushing into Asia. India's collision with Asia continues to raise&nbsp;the Himalaya Mountains.</li><li>A sliver of western California is on the Pacific plate, which is sliding northward past the North American Plate, i.e.,&nbsp;Los Angeles is moving towards San Francisco. This produces earthquakes (e.g. along the San Andreas fault in California) and volcanos (e.g. Mt. St. Helens in Washington State).</li></ul>
<p>Since the Earth is 4.5 x 10<sup>9</sup> years old, the continents have collided and rearranged their configurations dozens of times. For example, 200 million years ago, all continents were stuck together into one super-continent, Pangaea. Note that if there were no plate tectonics, volcanism, and mountain building, rain would erode the continents into oceans and there might be no&nbsp;"dry land" on Earth today.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Earth is unique among the planets in having a relatively large-sized moon - the Moon, which is 1/80 the mass of Earth and orbits at a distance of 55 Earth radii. For this reason the Earth-Moon system is occasionally referred to somewhat humorously as a "binary planet". The most likely way for such a massive and nearby Moon to have been formed is by a cataclysmic collision, towards the end of the formation of the Solar System, between the proto-Earth and another roughly Mars-sized planetesimal. The collision would have ejected a large amount of Earth's crust into orbit, where it could have collected into the spherical body we see today. Key consequences of Earth's large Moon for life on Earth are that it raises large tides in our oceans, and stabilizes the tilt of Earth's axis (which is responsible for the seasons) over very long timescales. Tides in the Earth-Moon system are also slowing down Earth's rotation, and hence, the length of a day: At the time of the dinosaurs, each day was ~23 hours long, and currently the day is lengthening by 2 milliseconds per century.&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 19px; line-height: 24px;">Mars</span></h2>
<p>Mars' rotation rate (1/24.6 hours) and axial tilt (25.19 deg) give it a day and seasonal temparature variations. However, Mars is significantly smaller and so has weaker gravity (40% of Earth's) and a much thinner atmosphere (<1% Earth's surface pressure), with a predominantly carbon dioxide (3% nitrogen) composition which offers no evidence of current life.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Below are three images of Mars. The first visual picture, from a telescope on Earth, shows dark and light patches once thought to be 'canals' built by the Martians themselves, along with a polar ice cap and some light cloud cover. The second visual picture (center) from an orbiting satellite probe shows the Valle Marineris, two large volcanos, streambeds, and craters. The third image shows the four extinct volcanoes in exaggerated relief. &nbsp;</p>

<p>The surface of Mars consists of lots of red-colored dust covering rocks (often a grey-greenish color), plus small polar ice caps of frozen CO<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;and H<sub>2</sub>O. The red color is from oxidized iron-rich minerals (i.e. rust). Some regions are heavily cratered - these are more ancient surfaces that have not changed in billions of years, while other lightly-cratered regions have been renewed more recently by lava (volcanism) or water erosion. The region of the planet imaged by VIking (image in center, and exaggerated model on right) exhibits four huge extinct volcanos and a huge canyon system.&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Olympus Mons</b>: largest volcano in the solar system (size of PA and 25 km high).&nbsp;<b>Valles Marineris</b>&nbsp;is the deepest and longest canyon system in the Solar System, as big as the U.S. It may have resulted from the separation of two tectonic plates long ago when the interior of the planet was still molten.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mars is now mostly cooled to a solid, but had a molten interior for much of its history. For some period (up to ~2 billion years ago?), active volcanism brought molten rock up from the interior. Most remarkably, small features around certain canyons and craters suggest that liquid water once flowed on Mars. Possibly due to a greenhouse effect and global warming from gases ejected by volcanos. Today nearly all the water on the surface is frozen. &nbsp;Only very recently have scientists found evidence for liquid water briefly being exposed on the surface of Mars (before sublimating or freezing). &nbsp;Carl Sagan and others suggest that life may have formed on Mars during its wet period. Following are some of the remarkable photos taken by Mars orbiters during the past decades showing the complex surface of the planet.</p>

<p>The interior of Mars is mostly solid, unlike Earth's interior that is molten. This is because Mars is smaller and less massive (about 1/10 the mass of Earth) and hence has cooled faster since its formation 4.5 billion years ago. (Mercury and the Moon are even smaller and have entirely cooled.) &nbsp;Earth's surface is very young, constantly remade by erosion (rain, rivers), volcanic lava flows, and plate tectonics. Mars's surface is partly old with many impact craters, and partly newer with lava flows and water erosion. The surfaces of planets thus reflect conditions in the planetary interiors.&nbsp;</p>
