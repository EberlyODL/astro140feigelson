<ol><li style="margin: 0.6em 0px 1.2em; padding: 0px;">Most of the discoveries were made possible by improving the sensitivity of existing instruments, sometimes made enormously better, by clever&nbsp;engineering. &nbsp;My respect for engineering teams, in universities & industry, U.S. and Europe, is really high ... they are often superb! &nbsp;</li><li style="margin: 0.6em 0px 1.2em; padding: 0px;">I personally didn't believe that gravitational lensing of planets would work. &nbsp;But with dozens of discoveries, often very valuable because they don't depend on the planet being near or far from the star, it clearly has been a success. This is a case where my&nbsp;evaulation&nbsp;at the time was wrong .... can't even trust my own judgment!&nbsp;</li><li style="margin: 0.6em 0px 1.2em; padding: 0px;">The&nbsp;<em>discovery</em>&nbsp;of planets is going very well, and spectroscopists are finally developing instruments that can&nbsp;<em>characterize</em>&nbsp;the planets' atmospheric composition and extent. &nbsp;But the astrophysicists who try to model the&nbsp;<em>origin</em>&nbsp;of planetary systems are having a tough time. &nbsp;The best earlier predictions proved entirely wrong when NASA's Kepler mission results emerged. &nbsp;The physical processes of planet formation are not just a calculation of Newton'g gravity, but involves the physics of rocks, ices, dust, pebbles, moons, ion-molecular chemistry, radioactive decay, ... ... &nbsp;I think that the theorists will be pondering these issues throughout the 21st century, just as theorists figured out the physical origin and structure of stars between ~1880-1970. &nbsp;</li></ol>
