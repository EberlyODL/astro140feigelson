<p>Chapter 3 of our text <em>An Introduction to Astrobiology</em>&nbsp;gives a detailed and very informative treatment of the Martian surface, atmosphere and history from the perspective of the question of whether the planet can -- or could in the past -- harbor living organisms. &nbsp;The final answer is that, despite intensive effort over decades, there is no evidence for life on Mars, but the possibility of past life is real. &nbsp; This Web page can be used as a commentary to assist as you read Chapter 3. We will skip text sections 3.4.4, 3.5 and 3.6, and all of the blue-color Boxes.</p>
<h3>Historical perspective (Chpt 3.1)</h3>
<p><br>Enthusiasm for the possibility -- even supposed certitude -- that life exists on Mars has persisted for centuries. Below left is a typical image of Mars obtainable from a ground-based telescope. &nbsp;In the late-1800s, Giovanni Schiaperelli claimed he saw `<i>canali'</i>, an Italian word that can mean either canals (implying that they were engineered, rather than arising through weathering) or&nbsp;channels (which can be either man-made or arising through weathering). &nbsp;'Canali' was translated to "canals" in English, and it just so happened to be during an era&nbsp;when humans were building increasingly impressive canals (shoftly after the completion of&nbsp;the Suez canal and before an early attempt at the Panama canal). &nbsp;&nbsp;In a series of popular books, Percival Lowell (1895-1908) proclaimed that they represented constructions of an advanced civilization dying of thirst. &nbsp;In 1898, author and futurist H. G. Wells wrote a popular novel about an invasion of Earth by technologically advanced Martians. &nbsp;This was recouped in 1938 in a radio drama by Orson Welles that caused widespread panic. &nbsp;By the late 1920s, it was well established that the surface of&nbsp;Mars was dry. Yet, some speculation remained, and&nbsp;it was not until NASA's robotic flybys (1960s) and landers (Viking missions, 1970s) that is was completely established that no large forms of life is present on Mars; &nbsp;thousands of pictures have been returned from the Martian surface, and no Martian animals, plants, footprints or other indications of large life forms is seen. &nbsp;The controversy today is whether there might be microbial life, or perhaps&nbsp;fossils of past life from an era when the climate was warmer and liquid water was prevalent.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: left; ">Martian geography (Chpt 3.1.1)</h3>
<p>Surprisingly, the most prominent feature of the Martian surface is actually not well-understood: the dramatic difference in cratering between the southern and northern hemispheres (Figure 3.5). &nbsp;This is known as the <em><strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martian_dichotomy" target="_blank">Martian dichotomy</a></strong>. &nbsp;</em>A heavily cratered surface is ancient, unchanged since the first ~billion years of the Solar System's 4.5 billion year history when many planetesimals remained from the planet formation process in the Sun's protoplanetary disk. &nbsp;In particular, several hundred million years after the formation, the planets were subject to the&nbsp;<em><strong>Late Heavy Bombardment</strong></em><strong> ...&nbsp;</strong>this caused, for example, the `mare' on our Moon. &nbsp;</p>
<p>If the southern portion of Mars' surface has been unchanged for most of its history, why is the northern portion (about 1/3 of the surface) so free of craters? One possibility is a truly giant impact hit the north after most of the other bombardment was completed. &nbsp;We see river beds flowing from the southern portion into the north, so perhaps evidence of the giant crater have been mostly eroded by water flows. &nbsp;Another possibility is early tectonic activity caused by a molten mantle under the Martian crust. &nbsp;Earth has a thin crust and lots of tectonic activity with ~20 plates that constantly slam into each other, subduct under each other, and cause volcanic eruptions. &nbsp;The result on Earth is that all ancient impact craters are erased. &nbsp;The giant canyon Valles Marineris on Mars does resemble a rift valley where two plates are separating on Earth, and there are several huge extinct volcanoes. &nbsp;But we really don't know the explanation for the Martian dichotomy.</p>

<p>[There are lots of details in this section that we don't have to study, including Table 3.1, Fig 3.9, and the details of chemical reactions (3.2)-(3.6)] &nbsp;</p>

<p>In our class on&nbsp;<em>The terrestrial planets</em> in our&nbsp;<em>Review of our Solar System</em>, we described many surface features of Mars indicating liquid water was present in the past: &nbsp;streambeds flowing from overfilled craters; craters surrounded by mud flows; dry meandering riverbeds; lake shorelines; gullies around the Valle Marineris canyon system; scarps (cliffs) around the base of Mons Olympus. &nbsp;Recent rovers making close-up studies of the Martian landscape found ripple patterns in rock; sedimentary layers of rock; carbonates (like limestone) and ball-shaped hematite minerals that can only form under water. &nbsp;Our text covers much of the same material in 3.4.1-2, but also discusses how advanced techniques (not simple imaging of the surface) can be used to locate current water content under the Martian surface (pp. 104-106). &nbsp;You can read online some recent findings about water on Mars released since the textbook was published&nbsp;including&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/MRO/news/mro20110804.html" style="color: rgb(2, 122, 198); text-decoration: none; " target="_blank">seasonal changes</a>&nbsp;in gullies, a layer of&nbsp;<a href="http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.cfm?release=2011-377&cid=release_2011-377" style="color: rgb(2, 122, 198); text-decoration: none; " target="_blank">gypsum</a>&nbsp;(calcium sulfate with water, CaSO<sub>4</sub>-2H<sub>2</sub>O), and radar indications of a former large&nbsp;<a href="http://www.marstoday.com/news/viewpr.html?pid=35969" style="color: rgb(2, 122, 198); text-decoration: none; " target="_blank">ocean</a>.

<p>If water once flowed on Mars, the atmosphere must have been more massive than it is today. &nbsp;If Mars had a significantly more massive atmosphere, then&nbsp;we would also suspect that the&nbsp;temperature on the surface where the water flowed would have been considerably warmer than the global average temperature on Mars today due to an increased greenhouse effect from more carbon dioxide and other gases (water? methane? sulfur dioxide? nitrous oxide?) in the past. &nbsp;Several causes for the gradual loss of warming atmosphere may be involved: &nbsp;the ablation (stripping away) of Mars' atmosphere by the Sun's wind (see <em>Amount of atmosphere</em> above); the destruction of water (H<sub>2</sub>O) by the Sun's ultraviolet radiation and subsequent loss of hydrogen to space; ejection due to the explosions from large asteroid impacts; the end of active volcanism as the planet cooled and crust thickened; chaotic changes in the planet's obliquity (axis of rotation). &nbsp;Our understanding of Mars' ancient climate is still quite uncertain and is actively studied today. &nbsp;Professor James Kasting in Penn State's College of Earth and Mineral Sciences is one of the world's distinguished scholars studying the atmospheres and climates of the terrestrial planets. &nbsp;You can see <a href="/courses/astro140/sites/edu.courses.astro140/files/content/kasting_early_mars_climate.pdf" style="color: rgb(2, 122, 198); text-decoration: none; ">a talk </a>he gave to astronomy undergraduates in 2008 on the early warming of Mars.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We&nbsp;have no evidence for life on Mars. &nbsp;No Martian rabbit has been photographed hopping across the surface of the planet. &nbsp;While sedimentary rocks have been seen, no fossils of ancient life has yet been photographed. &nbsp;There was once an argument that a meteorite called ALH 84001, that was ejected from the Martian surface by an asteroid impact, has micro-fossils, but it is not widely believed this evidence is not convincing (Chpt 3.5). &nbsp; No messages or visits from Martian civilizations have been identified (outside of fictional stories). &nbsp;</p>
<p>But with the clear knowledge that liquid water once flowed profusely on Mars, and the presence of carbon dioxide gas in the atmosphere and carbonate minerals in the rock indicating that organic (carbon-based) molecules were present, and of course the presence of sunlight as an energy source, we satisfy the basic conditions for the emergence of living organisms. &nbsp;Thus, there is intense interest today in establishing whether life once was present on Mars.</p>
<p>In the late-1970s, NASA launched two excellent probes that landed softly on Mars (although, unlike more recent probes, they did not have wheels and the ability to move) and provided our first close-up view of the Martian surface. &nbsp;These Viking landers had a robotic shovel that scooped up soil and placed in into three small laboratories specifically designed to search for active life forms (Chpt 3.3). &nbsp;The results were tantalizing! &nbsp;When Martian soil is placed into water, it fizzes, absorbing carbon dioxide and releasing oxygen just like green plants on Earth. &nbsp;However, a mass spectrometer experiment revealed no organic molecules at all. &nbsp;These apparently contradictory results have been explained as the consequence of the Sun's ultraviolet light irradiating the soil giving rise to suboxide or peroxide minerals. &nbsp;When placed in water, these materials can absorb carbon dioxide and emit oxygen ... but without any metabolism of living organisms (analogous to the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxjb2UJZ-5I" style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; " target="_blank">fizzing</a>&nbsp;of a common treatment for stomach distress). &nbsp;See details <a href="http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/O/OyamaHypoth.html" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<p>There is one other curiosity (sec 3.4.5). &nbsp;Telescopes in Hawaii have taken infrared spectra of the Martian atmosphere for many years. &nbsp;In 2003, <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/mars/news/marsmethane.html" target="_blank">methane</a> was seen over localized regions of the northern hemisphere during its summer. &nbsp;Methane on Mars should be rapidly (few years) destroyed by solar ultraviolet ... so where did it come from? Is it from the ancient atmosphere, trapped in the rock for billions of years and suddenly released? &nbsp;Or, as on Earth, is the methane generated by microbial life? &nbsp;This puzzle has not been solved. &nbsp;A recent&nbsp;probe by NASA, the <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/msl" target="_blank">Mars Science Lander</a> (nicknamed Curiosity), now on the Martian surface has a variety of advanced experiments specifically to look for microbial life. &nbsp;While there have been many <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/feature/jpl/nasa-rover-findings-point-to-a-more-earth-like-martian-past" target="_blank">interesting geological and geochemical results</a> supporting the idea that Mars once have significant liquid water,&nbsp;no evidence for current or past life has yet emerged. &nbsp;</p>
