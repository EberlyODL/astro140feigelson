<p>When a massive body &nbsp;passes in front of a luminous object (like another star) as seen from Earth, then the background starlight can be focussed and amplified by the intervening body. This process in known as `microlensing', a type of `gravitational lensing' that was known by Albert Einstein a century ago. As the foreground star passes slowly in front of the background star, the brightness of the background star shows a slow rise and fall in brightness, typically lasting several weeks. But if the foreground star also has one or more planets in a fortuitous orbital location, then the planet also causes a lensing event, but much quicker. See the diagram&nbsp;below.</p>

<p style="text-align: left; ">Perhaps the most remarkable system found so far using gravitational microlensing is named <a href="http://www.astronomy.ohio-state.edu/~microfun/ob06109/" target="_blank">OGLE-2006-BLG-109</a>. &nbsp;Its weird brightness variations are modeled by planets very similar to our Solar System: a Jupiter-mass planet and a Saturn-mass planet at distances 2 and 4 AU. &nbsp;Here is the brightness variation seen in 2006. &nbsp;Once the event was triggered, telescopes around the world (New Zealand, Australia, Israel, Canary Islands,&nbsp;Chile, United States) observed the star nearly continuously for ~10 days. &nbsp;This was essential to capture the complexity of the event, and thus model the planetary system. &nbsp;</p>
