<p><strong><em>Astronomers have made remarkable progress in discovering and characterizing exoplanets and the disks from which they emerged. &nbsp;Astrophysicists are making significant progress in modeling the processes of planet formation and planetary system evolution, although major questions still remain. &nbsp;Overall, from the 1980s to the present day, astronomy has laid an empirical foundation for the argument that the conditions for life are prevalent throughout the Galaxy. &nbsp;This is a remarkable scientific achievement. &nbsp; Here is an outline of what we have learned.</em></strong></p>

<p>With this foundation in empirical astronomical findings, we now turn to Theme V of the course where we ask more speculative questions: Could there be living organisms on these other planets? &nbsp;Could such organisms be intelligent, even more advanced technologically than us? &nbsp;Could such aliens have visited us, or could we visit them in the future? &nbsp;Could there be a Galactic-wide civilization? &nbsp;</p>
