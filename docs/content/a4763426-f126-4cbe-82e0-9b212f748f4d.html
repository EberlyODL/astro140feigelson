<p>For several decades, some astrophysicists have discussed arguments that the observed conditions of the physical Universe are closely linked in some way to the existence of living organisms such as ourselves. The sizes, masses and ages of objects we see (atoms, living organisms, planets, stars, galaxies, Universe) can all be related to a few basic physical constants: the relative strengths of gravitational, electrical, atomic and nuclear forces; the relative masses of protons and electrons; and parameters of cosmology. The existence of these objects thus places constraints on these elementary physical constants.</p>

<blockquote>
	<p>"The possibility of life as we know it evolving in the Universe depends on the values of a few basic physical constants—and is in some respects remarkably sensitive to their numerical values.'' (Carr & Rees, 1979)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For example, the existence of life on silicate + water planets requires that:</p>

<ul>
	<li>the universal expansion following the Big Bang is tuned to produce long-lived gravitationally collapsed structures.</li>
	<li>the ratio of light to particles in the Universe is sufficiently low to permit particles to form neutral atoms and permit gravitational collapse of stars.</li>
	<li>the constants of nuclear physics are tuned to give long-lived main sequence phases of stars and red giants that synthesize heavy elements.</li>
</ul>

<p>Together, such requirements place stringent constraints on the fundamental constants of nature, sometimes constraining them to with a few percent of their observed values. These arguments can be made in considerable detail. Here are some details:</p>

<ul>
	<li>If the expansion after the Big Bang was weaker than we observe (with other cosmological conditions left the same), then the Universe would expand only briefly before recollapsing. Long-lived stars and planets would not have time to exist. If the Big Bang were stronger than it was, particles would be dispersed before gravity could collect them into galaxies and stars. This requires a delicate balance of Dark Matter and Dark Energy.</li>
	<li>If the nuclear isotope of lithium 3Li were stable, then the fusion of 4 1H --> 4He would proceed directly and quickly in the cores of stars, and the main sequence phase would not last billions of years.</li>
	<li>If the carbon nucleus 12C had an energy state just below -- instead of just above -- the energy of a beryllium 8Be energy state, then red giant nucleosynthesis would end at beryllium and heavier elements such as carbon or oxygen would be rare.</li>
	<li>If Newton's law of gravity were F = GMm/r2.1 rather than GMm/r2.0, then there would be no stable orbits of a planet around a star.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p>These arguments are known as the Anthropic Principle. Several variations are discussed (weak Anthropic Principle, strong Anthropic Principle, final Anthropic Principle, etc). Many scientists dislike these arguments intensely: they seem post hoc, where observed phenomena somehow act backward in time on past conditions. How could the existence of humans 13 billion years after the formation of the Universe affect its properties?</p>

<p>But the problems of reverse causation are partly resolved if one considers the possibility of many Universes, each with different physical properties. Then, life would exist only in those with the necessary conditions; most universes would not have living organisms. The Many Universes Hypothesis (or multiverse) is now considered seriously by astrophysicists in the context of the latest theories of quantum relativity and inflationary cosmology. Perhaps Universes emerge from some quantum foam of virtual Universes? Perhaps the transition from inflation to ordinary expansion results occurs separately in different regions, each of which produces a Big Bang with different properties? Perhaps there `are' (in some sense of existence) many Universes within which only a very few have the carefully tuned conditions necessary for life. Of course, we must live in one of these rare Universes. </p>
