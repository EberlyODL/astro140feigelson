<p>In a fundamental way, life in the Universe would not be possible if our universe had not begun in a very peculiar state.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This point is important, and relates to one of the three perspectives on the nature of life that we have been discussing - specifically, the Schroedinger picture of life as a system that resists the decay to thermal equilibrium (for a while). In order to understand the importance of the universe's special initial state, and how it made life in this universe possible, we will have to go back to a very basic question: &nbsp;What is Time?&nbsp;</p>

<p></p>

<h3>What is Time?</h3>

<p>There are actually two very different ideas of time that we will need to clarify before we can discuss their relationship to life. Let's review these two ideas and see if we can't find a way to reconcile them into a single picture.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>1. Time is a Dimension</h3>

<p>In the first vision, time is a physical dimension of our universe - the dimension we measure with clocks. Just as we can measure the distances between two any two events using a ruler, we can measure the time between any two events using a clock. A "clock", for a scientist, is just any predictably periodic process, for example: &nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		<p>Motions of the Sun, Moon, and planets</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>The human heartbeat, or pulse</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>The motion of a pendulum, as first pointed out by Galileo</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>The regular motions of an analog wrist watch's springs and ratchets</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>The regular vibrations of a digital wrist watch's quartz crystal</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>The rates of atomic or nuclear transitions, as in "atomic clocks"</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>Pulsars observed by radio and X-ray astronomers</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Scientists have learned some basic facts about time as a dimension:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		<p>Some clocks are better than others</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>All clocks can be synchronized, to the limits of their accuracy</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>Psychological or subjective time, as we experience it, has some odd effects – stress, age (but these are&nbsp;not our focus here)</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>Various effects are observed thanks to Einstein’s relativity theories, and the finite speed of light</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Once we have accounted for all the objective effects, we find we can correct our measurements from one frame of reference to another, or from one observer to another, without any contradictions. So the picture holds.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, this vision of time does not capture every important aspect of our idea of time. We also need a completely different, second vision:&nbsp;</p>

<h3 style="text-align: center; "><img alt="Two paths diverge in a wood" src="https://courses.ed.science.psu.edu/_legacy/astro140/paths_in_wood.jpg" style="width: 400px; height: 190px;"></h3>

<p></p>

<h2>2. Time is Change</h2>

<p>In the second vision, time is the relentless process of change in our cosmos that transforms the unknown future into the unchanging past. There are many differences between the past and the future - not just subjectively! Even with respect to strictly physical measurements, time has a "direction" to it that space (out in outer space, that is) does not. For example:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		<p>We remember the past and don’t know the future</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>Complex systems evolve toward states of greater disorder, as codified in the famous&nbsp;Second Law of Thermodynamics: Entropy of closed systems (including the universe as a whole) is always increasing</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>Life's metabolic processes are&nbsp;thermodynamic processes:&nbsp;As pointed out by Schroedinger in our reading last week, life persists by eating "negative entropy" or order -&nbsp;in the form of food -&nbsp;from its surroundings, using it to increase and maintain internal order,&nbsp;and releasing entropy or disorder -&nbsp;in the form of heat and waste products - back to the outside world.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>All of our civilization's industrial processes also operate on this basis, taking in low-entropy fuel, "burning" or consuming it to carry out useful work, and&nbsp;releasing heat and high-entropy waste as a result.&nbsp;</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>Similarly, any&nbsp;process of recording data or making memories - creating a little bit of order in the universe - requires the disposal of "waste entropy" somewhere else.&nbsp;</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<div>
	<p>The directionality of time is often pictured as an “Arrow of Time” pointing away from the past, toward the future. (Sometimes, different arrows of time are discussed, but in the end, these all amount to different versions of the Second Law of Thermodynamics.) From an ordinary, everyday point of view, there is nothing strange about this.&nbsp;</p>

	<p>However, from the point of view of time as a dimension (Vision #1), the difference between past and future is a very odd one indeed. The&nbsp;"directionality" of time is simply not something that physical dimensions intrinsically possess. Out in space there is no difference between&nbsp;left and right, forward and backward, or up and down. Similarly, elementary particle interactions do not recognize any distinction between the two directions of time; the underlying physical laws that govern their motions do not care whether we run our clocks forward or in reverse. So where does the arrow of time come from?&nbsp;</p>

	<p>The answer, it turns out, comes down to an aphorism of the Nobel laureate Philip Anderson, "More is Different."&nbsp;</p>

	<h2>Reconciling the Two Visions of Time</h2>

	<p>The conflict between the two visions of time, one imagining a clockwork (backwards and forwards!) universe, and the other grappling with the messy developing reality of steam engines, friction, and metabolic processes,&nbsp;came to a head in the latter half of the 19th century. Happily for a civilization that was beginning to feel a bit embarrassed about the conflict between its physical theories and its increasingly important industrial processes, these two competing visions were eventually reconciled. The work began with a group of theorists who developed statistical models for the behavior of systems with large numbers of particles, a mole (6.2 x 10<sup>23</sup>) or more, and reached its conclusion in the work of Austrian theorist Ludwig Boltzmann (1844-1906), who successfully connected this new science of <em>statistical mechanics</em> to the laws of thermodynamics that were already known, including the second law. &nbsp;</p>

	<p></p>

	<p style="text-align: center; "><img alt="" src="https://courses.ed.science.psu.edu/_legacy/astro140/boltzmann_tomb.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: 356px;"></p>

	<p></p>

	<p>What Boltzmann found was that the complexity of the system under study - the number of interacting particles - makes all the difference between a clockwork, reversible system and the messy world of ever-increasing entropy that we live in. Specifically, the seemingly irreversible nature of complex systems results from nothing more or less than the very large number of interacting particles that they contain, and the extreme improbability of them "accidentally" organizing themselves in any particular way without the action of outside forces. Consider: a single hydrogen atom (proton + electron) will easily ionize (break apart) or recombine (come back together); it may even switch back and forth between these two states a million times a second. A single egg, however (~10<sup>23</sup> particles), while it will readily break apart, will not so readily be put back together again. As Boltzmann showed, the contrast in behavior between the two systems - the contrast between our two visions of time - springs solely from the large number of particles involved in the egg, by comparison to the atom. His conclusions:&nbsp;</p>

	<ul>
		<li>
			<p>No "Arrow of Time" exists&nbsp;for simple systems, nor for complex systems once they reach equilibrium.&nbsp;</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>The Second Law of Thermodynamics is a&nbsp;<em>probabilistic</em> law: Entropy can decrease&nbsp;(eggs unscramble!)&nbsp;even for complex&nbsp;systems,&nbsp;just with extreme, extreme&nbsp;rarity (in the case of the egg,&nbsp;only after many lifetimes of the universe).&nbsp;</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>Complex&nbsp;systems put in a low-entropy initial state&nbsp;exhibit an "Arrow of Time" as they&nbsp;evolve, in highly predictable fashion,&nbsp;to higher entropy states and eventually&nbsp;equilibrium (maximum entropy).</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>Since the universe around us exhibits an "Arrow of Time", we observe it in exactly this phase of its evolution.&nbsp;</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>This rather unusual state of the universe can be understood if its entropy was very low in the distant past.&nbsp;</p>
		</li>
	</ul>

	<p>The last conjecture, known as Boltzmann’s “Past Hypothesis,” has been validated with superb precision by astronomers' studies of the cosmic microwave background radiation. This radiation provides us with a picture of the infant universe as it existed at 380,000 years of age, 99.997% of the way back to the Big Bang, and it shows a universe of extreme smoothness, and incredibly small entropy - much smaller than its entropy today, and even smaller than its maximum equilibrium entropy will be in the distant future.&nbsp;</p>

	<h3>Time, Entropy, and Life in the Universe</h3>

	<p>Since life can only persist in regions of space, and during times, where it is able to extract order from its surroundings (Schroedinger's definition, from last week), all life owes its existence to the extremely low-entropy state that our universe exhibited at its creation.&nbsp;</p>

	<p>Recalling that low-entropy states are low-probability states, this means that our universe was for some reason created in an extremely, extremely improbable state. To theorists today, this is one of the great outstanding puzzles about the origins of the universe. In the next set of notes we will discuss the only approach that has been able to make progress on this fundamental question....&nbsp;</p>
