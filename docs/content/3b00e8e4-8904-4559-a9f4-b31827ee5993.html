<p>Throughout the semester, you will read the online "lectures" at this website and listen to&nbsp;ocassional videos. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Starting in Week 3, we will be reading much of the required textbook:</p>
<p><b>An Introduction to Astrobiology</b>, David A. Rothery et al. (editors), 2nd edition, 2011,Cambridge University Press, ISBN 978-1-107-60093-5 (paperback) <a href="http://www.cambridge.org/9781107600935" target="_blank">http://www.cambridge.org/9781107600935</a></p>
<p>The book can be acquired from online booksellers including the <a href="http://www.cambridge.org/9781107600935" target="_blank">publisher</a>, <a href="http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/introduction-to-astrobiology-david-a-rothery/1102830074" target="_blank">Barnes & Noble</a>, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/An-Introduction-Astrobiology-David-Rothery/dp/1107600936" target="_blank">Amazon</a>. &nbsp;This is an excellent resource where several British scientists join together to write highly informative chapters on most aspects of our course. &nbsp;The text is more detailed than the online `lectures' and students do not need to memorize or study intensively all of its contents. &nbsp;But it gives lots of substantive detail underlying the issues we discuss, and is a valuable complement to the lectures. &nbsp; Please be sure to have the text in hand by Week 3.&nbsp;</p>
