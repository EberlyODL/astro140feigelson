<p><em><strong>This topic is treated in detail in our text, sec 6.6.2. &nbsp;Fig 6.18 shows the first detected exoplanetary signal in the spectrum of the solar-like star 51 Pegasi. &nbsp;But we will not be responsible for the full mathematical treatment in the text. &nbsp;It is useful to look it over: for example, equation (6.20) shows how the orbit size (a<sub>p</sub>) can be established from the orbital period and the mass of the host star, and equation (6.24) shows how the mass of the planet (M<sub>p</sub>) can be estimated from the maximum Doppler velocity of the star, its mass, and the orbit size. &nbsp; But we don't have to learn all of the mathematical details. &nbsp;</strong></em></p>
<p>The most successful technique for detection and confirmation of planets has been via the small, periodic (repeating) alternating Doppler redshifts and blueshifts in the star's light which indicate it is being pushed and pulled by an unseen planet. Swiss astronomers Michel Mayor and Didier Queloz (see Fig. 7.1 on page 233) made the first discovery of a planet around a Sun-like star in 1995 with their detection of a periodic wobble in the motions of the star 51 Pegasi. Since then, they and other groups have found several hundred&nbsp;planets via the Doppler wobbles of Sun-like stars due to their orbiting planets. &nbsp;As of October 2016,&nbsp;<a href="http://exoplanets.org/table" target="_blank">Exoplanets Data Explorer</a>&nbsp;(set the "Filter" to say "PLANETDISCMETH == 'RV' ") lists 482 planets, while&nbsp;the catalog at the&nbsp;<a href="http://exoplanet.eu/catalog.php" style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; " target="_blank">Extrasolar Planets Encyclopedia</a>&nbsp;lists over 600.</p>
<p>The Doppler effect is illustrated in the first diagram below. The unseen planet orbits the visible star, which undergoes a small blueshift (motion towards us) when the planet is receding, and a small redshift (motion away from us) when the planet is approaching. &nbsp;The second image below shows the complicated visible band spectrum of a Sun-like star showing the many absorption lines that shift blueward and redward as the planet orbits the star. &nbsp;Tthe Dopper shifts are smaller than 1-part-in-a-million, so the shifts are smaller than the width of a line. &nbsp;The best spectrograph today, built specially for planet detection, can detect stellar motions as small as 1 meter/sec (walking speed), or a few billionths of the rest wavelength of the absorption line. &nbsp;</p>

<div>The astronomer takes the spectrum of a star over and over again -- for weeks, months and years -- &nbsp;hoping to find some variation in the radial velocity. &nbsp;If a variation is found, then mathematical tools are used to search for the orbital period which can range from days to years. &nbsp;The radial velocity data are `folded' modulo this period and replotted like the following graph. &nbsp;</div>

<p>In this case, the star exhibits a +10 to -10 meter/s motion with the planet's orbital period of 17 days. &nbsp;The shape of the curve gives the eccentricity of the system; a pure sine wave indicates a perfectly circular orbit. &nbsp;A calculation based on Newton's Laws of Motion and Gravity allow the mass of the planet to be estimated; here it about 0.11 times the mass of Jupiter. &nbsp;So, we have a case here of a `hot Nepture' orbiting closer to the star than Mercury orbits our Sun (Mercury's orbital period is about 3 months, greater than 17 days). &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
