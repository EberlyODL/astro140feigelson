<p>If other intelligences exist in the Galaxy, how do we best communicate with them?</p>

<ul>
	<li><b>Hard X-rays/gamma-ray</b>s: Hard to produce, impossible to focus</li>
	<li><b>Ultraviolet/soft X-rays</b>: Absorbed by atoms in interstellar gas (and Earth's atmosphere)</li>
	<li><b>Optical</b>: Signals overwhelmed by starlight</li>
	<li><b>Infrared/millimeter</b>: Overwhelmed by interstellar & interplanetary dust emission (and Earth's atmosphere)</li>
	<li><b>Centimeter-wavelength (1-30 GHz) radio</b>: YES!</li>
	<li><b>Longer than meter wavelength</b>: Overwhelmed by interstellar electron synchrotron emission</li>
	<li><b>Non-electromagnetic radiation</b>: neutrino beams? neutron beams? other subatomic particles? Technologies ineffective or not available.</li>
</ul>

<p>Large radio telescopes sensitive to centimeter wavelength light are easily constructed (e.g. Arecibo Telescope in Puerto Rico, Very Large Array in New Mexico - photos below), radio waves are easily focused (paraboloid shaped dishes), radio receivers are extremely sensitive for reception, and radio broadcasting is easy (e.g. TV stations, radar at airports). Existing radio telescopes could easily detect a typical terrestrial radio/TV broadcast across the Galaxy -- if it were beamed directly towards us.</p>

<h2>What Frequency to Use?</h2>

<p>Examples: AM band from 0.5-1.6 MHz; FM from 88-108 MHz; TV scattered from 50-1000 MHz, plus police/taxi radios, airport/military radar, long-distance telephone, satellite communications, cellphones (rapidly growing), etc. Only a few narrow bands are kept quiet for radio astronomy.&nbsp; Arguments have been made that the best frequency to use is around 1420 MHz (21.1 cm), the emission line of cold hydrogen.</p>

<p>Solution: build receivers that analyze signals from many (million, billion!) channels simultaneously within radio astronomical bands.</p>

<h2>How Do We Recognize an Alien Signal?</h2>

<p>Criteria might include: narrow band signal at wavelength not produced by atoms & molecules; rapid variations in signal intensity (a message!) but not a radio pulsar; signal seen from star with good lifezone for habitable planets: signal seen in different telescopes (not local interference); periodic intensity or Doppler shifts from from their planet's rotation/orbit; signal contains complex information.</p>

<h2>Could Earth be Detected by Other Civilizations?</h2>

<p>Major emission in centimeter band are military radar (esp. over Alaska and Siberia) and TV stations (esp. over US and Europe). Arecibo Telescope could detect these signals out to a few parsecs (tens of stars). TV broadcasts from 1978 had ~10 million watts power, and are now 20 lightyears (6 pc) away with ~20 A-G-K main sequence stars. So not much chance we have been detected yet.</p>
