<h5><strong>Papers for ASTRO 140 Life in the Universe</strong></h5><p>GOALS</p><ul><li>Provide students with the opportunity to investigate a narrow scientific issue in some detail;</li><li>Challenge the student to assimilate diverse information into a coherent narrative;</li><li>Provide training in the art of scientific writing.</li></ul><p><strong>TOPICS  </strong> Paper topics should be chosen from the list of recommended topics (with recommended research materials) provided by the instructor later in the semester.  A student with a strond desire for a special topic should present it, with ideas for research materials, for prior approval by the instructor.  Our textbook and Wikipedia provide useful starting points for your research on most topics, but are not enough by themselves for a strong paper.  If you have difficulty identifying resources (or obtaining full-text versions), please freely contact the instructor. </p><p>LENGTH AND FORMAT   The typical length is 3-4 pages text followed by pages for references and useful figures (perhaps .jpg taken from the Web). A cover page can be added.  The paper should be submitted prepared with a word processing system like Microsoft Word or Google Docs. The text is single-spaced with Arial or Times Roman font, 12pt font size, with 1" margins for 8.5x11 inch or A4 paper.  Papers may be submitted in either .docx or .pdf fomat with file names like "Lastname_Paper1.pdf".    </p><p>RESEARCH MATERIAL AND REFERENCING Each paper should make significant use of at least three sources beyond the text and Wikipedia.  Sources can include both general background sources and specialized sources;  it is great to have one or more peer-review research journal articles.   All sources(except the text and Wikipedia) should be included in the list of references and cited in the text.  Avoid many similar citations to the same source.  The example here in red illustrates referencing of book, article and Web material:</p><p><span style="color:#B22222;"><span class="foundation_access-secondary_color ">Cyanobacteria, also called blue-green algae, is not commonly seen today but dominated all lifeforms before the Cambrian Explosion 0.5 billion years ago.  Through photosynthesis, it had a dramatic effect on the composition of the Earth's atmosphere around 2 billion years ago (Kasting 2005, Chpt. 4; Lane 2010).  American and Australian geobiologists recently traced the genetic family tree of cyanobacteria found that only one of dozens of species evolved to produce oxygen (Perkins 2017).</span></span></p><p><span style="color:#B22222;"><span class="foundation_access-secondary_color ">Kasting, J. 2010, <em>How to Find a Habitable Earth</em>, Princeton Univ Press</span></span></p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Lane" title="Nick Lane"><span style="color:#B22222;">Lane, Nick</span></a><span style="color:#B22222;"> 2010, </span><a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20527461-100-first-breath-earths-billion-year-struggle-for-oxygen/" rel="nofollow"><span style="color:#B22222;">"First breath: Earth's billion-year struggle for oxygen"</span></a><span style="color:#B22222;">, </span><i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Scientist" title="New Scientist"><span style="color:#B22222;">New Scientist</span></a><span style="color:#B22222;">,</span></i><span style="color:#B22222;"> February pp36–9</span></p><p><span style="color:#B22222;">Perkins, R. 2017, "How do plants make oxygen?

The paper's overall organization looks like a U: it begins with a short statement of motivation or scientific issue; most of the text presents the evidence or argument (some combination of empirical findings and scientific modelling); and the paper ends with a discussion of how the results relate to the original motivation. Within this framework, the paragraphs should follow a logical trail. Each paragraph should communicate one thought clearly.  Within a paragraph, sentences should be well-constructed.  Nouns and verbs should be informative (e.g. "The Martian photographs show ..." rather than "It was found ...").  First person pronouns should be avoided (e.g. not "I" or "my").  Colloquialisms and cliches should be avoided (e.g. "The experiment failed" rather than "It was a dismal failure").  Please read the following background materia: </p><ul><li><a href="https://online.science.psu.edu/sites/default/files/astro140/Feigelson%20advice.rtf" target="_blank">Eric Feigelson's general advice for astronomy writing</a> (download)</li><li><a href="http://www.astro.indiana.edu/catyp/science_write.html" target="_blank">Caty Pilachowski's tips for astronomy writing</a></li><li><a href="https://online.science.psu.edu/sites/default/files/astro140/William%20Safire%27s%20Rules.pdf" target="_blank">William Safire's rules for writers</a> (humorous)</li><li><a href="https://online.science.psu.edu/sites/default/files/astro140/Writing%20in%20the%20sciences.pdf" target="_blank">Writing in the sciences</a></li><li><a href="https://online.science.psu.edu/sites/default/files/astro140/Astro%20writing%20problems.pdf" target="_blank">Astro writing problems</a> (Feigelson)</li></ul><p><strong>ACADEMIC INTEGRITY <em>Plagiarism is strictly prohibited.</em></strong> See the University document <a href="https://psu.box.com/v/PlagiarismAndYou">https://psu.box.com/v/PlagiarismAndYou</a> for more details.  The presence of plagiarized text will be checked using specialized University-provided software. For example, you are not permitted to cut and paste text from the Web.   <strong>Extensive quotations from any source are also inappropriate.  R</strong>ather, the student should seek to understand and restate the issues in a new voice, summarizing and synthesizing diverse material (with appropriate reference).   </p><p>SUBMISSION A draft of Paper 1 is due <b>Friday February 9, </b>final version of Paper 1 is due <b>Friday March 2, </b>and Paper 2 is due by <b>Monday April 30</b> (first day of Exam Week)<b>.  </b>Each of these writing assignments is to be submitted via <a href="http://canvas.psu.edu" target="_blank">Canvas</a>.  </p><p><strong><em>Students are strongly encouraged to informally consult with the instructor as they progress with the papers. </em></strong></p><p></p>
