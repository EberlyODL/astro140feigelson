<p>In the early 20th century, astronomers knew only about stars relatively near the Sun in the Milky Way. But there were some blurry objects in the sky known as `nebulae'. Around 1920, the talented American astronomer <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/aso/databank/entries/bahubb.html" style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; color: rgb(0, 77, 150); text-decoration: none; " target="_blank">Edwin Hubble</a>&nbsp;used a large new telescope in California to obtain improved photographs of the nebulae. Some appeared to be huge, but very distant, structures similar to the Milky Way. With repeated observations of the nebula Messier 31 in the Andromeda constellation, Hubble demonstrated it was a distinct "island universe," or galaxy. He and others photographed many other galaxies. &nbsp;</p>

Because the Sun lies in the disk of our Galaxy, we cannot see its structure as we can with distant face-on galaxies. &nbsp;But recent images of the full sky have shows that our galaxy is very similar to other spiral galaxies. &nbsp;The first photo below is an all-sky composite of our Galaxy as seen from Earth. &nbsp;Note the similarity to the edge-on spiral shows above. &nbsp;The second image below is obtained at infrared wavelengths of light where the obscuring clouds have little effect. &nbsp;The final image below is a recent artist's drawing, consistent with modern observations, showing our Galaxy &nbsp;as it would appear if seen face-on. &nbsp;Note the Sun is about 25,000 light-years (8000 parsecs) from the center, and lies between two spiral arms. The central region of the Galaxy has a large bar, and a modest 3x10<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;M<sub>o</sub>&nbsp;massive black hole lies at the very core.</p>

<p>Astronomers study star and planet formation in the closest spiral arms which do not suffer too much obscuration from interstellar clouds and are nearby so that small and faint structures can be detected. &nbsp;For example, a major nusery of young stars near the Sun is the Orion Nebula in the Orion Nebula Cloud, which likes in the Orion Spur shown in the above diagram. &nbsp;It is only ~400 pc (parsecs, 1 pc ~ 3 light-years ~ 3x10<sup>16</sup> meters) away, much closer than the Galactic Center at a distance around 8,000 pc. &nbsp;</p>
