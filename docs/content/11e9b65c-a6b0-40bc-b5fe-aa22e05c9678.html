<p>Let us now look at some of the collective properties of planetary systems known today, keeping in mind that these are small and biased samples. &nbsp;</p>
<h2>Results from Radial Velocity Surveys</h2>
<p>Radial velocity surveys have various limitations, but they can find planetary systems with reasonable reliability when the planet's gravitional pull is sufficiently strong; &nbsp;that is, the planet's mass can't be too small and its orbital period can not too long. &nbsp;In particular, expect the radial velocity surveys to undercount the lower mass planets ... they are particularly good at finding the more massive gaseous (Jupiter-like) planets. &nbsp;Using Newton's version of Kepler's Third Law of Planetary Orbits, we can estimate the mass of these planets ... but we don't get their radius. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The following diagrams have been extensively discussed as important summaries of the radial velocity surveys. &nbsp;The first one plots&nbsp;the planetary mass in units of Jupiter's mass&nbsp;against the semi-major axis (i.e. radius for a circular orbit)&nbsp;in Astronomical Units.&nbsp; We use logarithmic units because the range of the variables is very large; so the masses range from around 0.001 M<sub>Jup</sub> (1e-3) to 100 M<sub>Jup</sub> (1e+2). &nbsp;The second diagram plots the orbit's eccentricity (where 0 is a circular orbit and 0.9 is highly elongated) against the semi-major axis. It is useful to remember where Earth lies on these&nbsp;plots: it has mass = 0.003&nbsp;M<sub>Jup</sub>, radius = 0.09 R<sub>Jup</sub>, semi-major axis = 1.0 AU, and eccentricity near 0.0.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The first plot seems to show three distinct groups:&nbsp;</p>
<ol><li style="text-align: left; ">Starting on the left side, we see planets with roughly Jupiter's mass and very small orbits, a few percent of an AU. &nbsp;These planets&nbsp;orbit their host stars in a few days, rather than in a few years as we seen in our Solar System. &nbsp;51 Peg b, the first clearly detected planet (1995), is one of these planets. &nbsp;These are nicknamed&nbsp;<strong>hot Jupiters</strong>, because they low so close to their host stars; indeed, in a few cases, we see spectroscopic evidence that the gases from the planet's atmosphere are being heated and flow away from the host star. &nbsp;But we need to explain how these planets got their tiny orbits considering that Jupiters are expected to form in the outer parts of protoplanetary disks.&nbsp;</li><li style="text-align: left; ">We then see a &nbsp;group of planets with masses around 0.03 M<sub>Jup</sub> ~ 10 M<sub>Earth</sub> with orbit sizes around 0.1 AU. &nbsp;These were found relatively recently using the most accurate spectrographs; then are nicknamed&nbsp;<strong>super-Earths.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;In most cases, they lie too close to the host star to be in the Habitable Zones, so they are hot ... in some cases, the surface may be molten rock!</li><li style="text-align: left; ">A considerable number of radial velocity planets have masses several times Jupiter and orbit sizes of several AU. &nbsp;Clearly, our Jupiter is a rather modest planet among the gaseous giants orbiting other planets.&nbsp;</li></ol>
<p style="text-align: left; ">The second diagram above shows that many planets have very eccentric (elliptical) orbits. &nbsp; This was a big surprise! &nbsp;In our Solar System, planet orbits are nearly circular (eccentricities&nbsp;mostly&nbsp;less than that 0.05). &nbsp;In the early years around 1995-2000, we found mostly&nbsp;<strong><em>eccentric Jupiters, </em></strong>but today with more sensitive spectrographs, we see eccentric super-Earths too. &nbsp;This raises a big question:&nbsp;how did these planets got high eccentricities considering that they formed in protoplanetary disks where the orbits should be nearly perfectly circular.</p>
<p style="text-align: left; ">If we count the number of planets found with radial velocity surveys against the number of stars that were observed, we found that at least 10% of all Sun-like stars examined show radial velocity signatures of Jovian planets. &nbsp;And there are probably many more stars with less massive&nbsp;planets that cannot be detected in this fashion. &nbsp;But by this method alone, we predict that (for a trillion stars in our Galaxy) there will be tens-to-hundreds of billions of planets in our Galaxy. &nbsp;Wow! &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left; ">A major lesson from both diagrams is that few systems resemble our Solar System. &nbsp;The terrestrial planets (Mercury through Mars) would not be detectable using radial velocity methods, so our Solar System would show only two planets on these graphs:&nbsp;&nbsp;Jupiter (1 M<sub>Jup</sub> mass at 5 AU semi-major axis and 5% eccentricity), and Saturn (0.3 M<sub>Jup</sub> at 10 A.U. and 6% eccentricity). It is not yet clear whether our Solar&nbsp;System has a rare configuration of planets, or whether better surveys will find many Solar System analogs. &nbsp;</p>
<h2>Results from Transiting Planets</h2>
<p>The Kepler survey is, by far, the best source of transiting planets. &nbsp;Kepler has detected over 8,000 probable planetary systems of which >1000 are `confirmed' with additional spectroscopic evidence. &nbsp;But it is widely believed that >90% of the Kepler `probable' planets are real, and that many more planetary transits are hidden by brightness variations in the host star. &nbsp;That is why you are participating in the PlanetHunters citizen science effor&nbsp;to find new transits within variable light curves! &nbsp;</p>
<p>The computer-generated poster below shows the host stars (with realistic surface colors) and small black dots to representing the sizes of the transiting planet.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The plot below compares the radii of Kepler planets (in units of R<sub>Jup</sub>, Jupiter's radius) to their orbit size (in units of AU, the Earth-Sun distance). &nbsp;Recall that the transit method can give the planet's radius (by timing the ingress/egress of the transit lightcurve) but not the planet's mass or eccentricity. &nbsp;<img alt="" src="https://courses.ed.science.psu.edu/astro140/sites/courses/ed/astro140/files/mooc_images/a-vs-r.png"></p>
<ol><li>We clearly see again a clump of Jupiter-like planets (R~1-2 R<sub>Jup</sub>) with very small orbits (a~0.02-0.06 AU). &nbsp;These are the&nbsp;<strong>hot Jupiters</strong> that we saw in the radial velocity surveys above.</li><li>Most of the planets have sizes between ~0.07 and ~0.4 R<sub>Jup</sub>. &nbsp;For comparison, in our Solar System Neptune has radius 0.35 R<sub>Jup</sub> and Earth has radius 0.09 R<sub>Jup</sub>. &nbsp;So these exoplanets are often called&nbsp;<strong>Neptunes, super-Earths,&nbsp;</strong>and&nbsp;<strong>Earths. &nbsp;</strong>Note however the tilt in the lower envelope of the Kepler planets in this diagram. This is an instrumental limitation: transits of very small planets orbiting far from the star produce transits too faint for the Kepler detectors to see. &nbsp;Thus there are only a couple (out of thousands) of Kepler exoplanets that are <b>Earth twins</b> with radius ~0.09 R<sub>Jup</sub> and orbit ~1 AU. &nbsp;</li></ol>
<p>The Kepler Team has performed a final re-analysis of its data, and the latest list of Kepler planetary candidates should be announced in 2006 (possibly during our semester). &nbsp;Below is a histogram of&nbsp;planet radii shown by the Kepler Team at&nbsp;conferences from their earlier analysis. &nbsp;&nbsp;The most common planets found are super-Earths and Neptunes, and Jupiters are much rarer. &nbsp;Earths (and sub-Earths??) are probably much more numerous than found due to instrumental limitations.</p>
