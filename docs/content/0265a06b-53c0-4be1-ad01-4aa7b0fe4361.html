<div style="text-align: center;">Can people distinguish between science and pseudo-science?</div>
<p>A poll of 1000 adult Americans by the Center for Survey and Research Analysis in 2005 shows that</p>
<ul><li>60% believe extraterrestrial life exists on other planets.</li><li>37% believe that houses can be haunted</li><li>25% believe people can hear from, or communicate mentally, with the dead</li><li>25% think that astrology can affect people</li><li>51% said no to the statement: "Do you believe that extraterrestrial beings have visited Earth at some time in the past" &nbsp;<small>(This view in decreasing in popularity: 41% said No in a 1990 poll, and 38% said No in a 2001poll)</small></li></ul>
<p>The International Center for the Study of Scientific Literacy <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/1996/05/24/MN67867.DTL" target="_blank">reports</a> that 20% of Americans are not sure whether the Sun revolves around the Earth or the other way â€˜round.</p>
<p>One should be careful in interpreting survey results. &nbsp;For example, a non-random Internet survey from a radio show "The X Zone" with 19,000 respondents found 77% believe in ghosts and 93% do not believe astronauts really walked on the Moon.&nbsp; See Seth Shoshak <a href="http://www.space.com/searchforlife/seti_shostak_believe_051103.html" target="_blank">discussion</a> for details.</p>

<p>One can argue that UFOs definitely exist: anything in the air that is not immediately explained is unidentified. Upon investigation, 90% of reports to the <a href="http://www.cufos.org/" target="_blank">Center for UFO Studies</a> end up identified (nocturnal advertising aircraft, Venus or other planets, weather balloons, atmospheric refraction, hoaxes, pranks, etc). Similarly, only a few of the 1000 incidents reported to the 1960s panel headed by astronomer J. Allen Hynek were difficult to explain. These often depended on the testimony of unreliable witnesses (e.g. who make other unsubstantiated and unlikely claims). Lawyers and judges know that eyewitness accounts are often very inaccurate.</p>
<p>It is quite suspicious that the number of UFO sightings are highly variable (e.g. 1966 had 3 times as many reports as 1963, 1952 was 8 times higher than 1951) but the fraction that remain unexplained always remains ~1%, according to the US Air Force Project Bluebook. How could the many people reporting false sightings know that the small number of true UFO sightings has increased or decreased? A more reasonable explanation is that none of the sightings are due to aliens, are 1% are simply completely false or too complicated to easily understand.</p>
<p>One complication is the assertion that the U.S. government has knowledge of UFOs and suppresses it. &nbsp;Indeed, it's not uncommon for&nbsp;governments or people with political power to try to keep secrets. &nbsp;However, it's also quite common that such secrets eventually become public. &nbsp;For example,&nbsp;the Roswell Incident (strange stuff falling from the sky in New Mexico in 1947, early reports of recovery of a large disk) may have a factual basis in secret Air Force research involving aviation and balloon technology which has only recently been declassified. However, there is no evidence that the government is withholding any evidence that UFOs are of extraterrestrial origin.</p>
<p>Another complication is that hoaxes, pranks and frauds are also common among UFO sightings and similar claims for alien presence. &nbsp;The most famous case (not flying objects) are the British crop circles. &nbsp;These strange geometric patterns appeared overnight randomly in English wheat and or other crop fields for ~30 years. &nbsp;Then, in 1991, two men admitted to creating the circles as a hoax since 1978, and they demonstrated their method for journalists (see instructions&nbsp;<a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Make-a-Crop-Circle" style="color: rgb(2, 122, 198); text-decoration: none; " target="_blank">here</a>). &nbsp;Thousands of copy-cat patterns appeared worldwide. &nbsp;&nbsp; See a good presentation of the&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crop_circle" style="color: rgb(2, 122, 198); text-decoration: none; " target="_blank">crop circle story on Wikipedia</a>. &nbsp;Nonetheless, many fans believe they arise from magical or extraterrestrial causes (e.g. see the million-view YouTube video&nbsp;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ql1PPkZiHl8" style="color: rgb(2, 122, 198); text-decoration: none; " target="_blank">here</a>).</p>
<p>Recall also that millions of people suffer from schizophrenia and similar serious mental diseases that involve hallucinations. &nbsp;They often cannot distinguish their internal experience of imaginary phenomena from real experiences of physical phenomena. &nbsp;Subjective reports can thus be wrong due to honest error, purposeful fraud, or medical disease.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here are some further thoughts from the Center for UFO Studies:</p>
<p>About 90%-95% of all UFO reports prove to be IFOs [Identified Flying Objects], after an examination of the evidence by a trained investigator. People report natural or conventional objects as UFOs because they do not recognize them as such, due to unusual environmental conditions, ignorance, or the rarity of a natural event. For example, people have reported the planet Venus as a UFO ... or stars near the horizon. ... Generally, sightings occur in rural areas, small towns, and near military installations.</p>
<p>Returning to Unidentified Flying Objects, there are few unquestionably authentic pictures of UFOs. Many so-called UFO photographs are really natural phenomena (such as strangely shaped clouds) or are light leaks in the camera or flaws that were introduced when the film was developed. Some photos are deliberate hoaxes made by people who want you to believe they have seen UFOs; for any number of reasons, such as fame, money, or to promote a religious or philosophical viewpoint.</p>
<p>Recently, the most significant Radar-Visual cases have come from Belgium where triangular-shaped UFOs were seen by military personnel and civilians and detected on military radar. The Belgian Air Force has publicly aired recordings of radar trackings that show objects making fantastic maneuvers at incredibly high speeds that are far beyond the capabilities of conventional aircraft. &nbsp;</p>
<p>There is increasing discussion of the possibilities that some UFO sightings are new technology military aircraft.&nbsp; Here are photos of a few publicly known advanced aircraft from the U.S. military: AGM-129 cruise missile, Boeing X-15A Waverider, Honeywell RQ-16 T-Hawk, McDonnell Douglas A-12 Avenger II (cancelled), and a MZ-3A blimp. The images are from Wikipedia. &nbsp;These aircraft definitely look odd, and might be mistaken for a UFO. &nbsp;And there are probably more advanced aircraft being tested that are not yet announced.</p>

<p>Despite the lack of success in discovering extraterrestrial signals, all astronomers consider the evidence for many habitable worlds to be very convincing, and thus the possibility of extraterrestrial life (though difficult to quantify) is not necessarily low. Yet nearly all astronomers discount the argument that Unidentified Flying Objects are good evidence for spaceships from extraterrestrial intelligences. &nbsp;Why such skepticism? &nbsp;</p>
<p>The main problem is that the evidence for the UFO-alien connection is always so fragmentary. Why are UFO photographs usually blurred or indistinct, or easily altered using Photoshop? Why is there no physical evidence anywhere (even claimed by UFO enthusiasts) for alien materials or technologies? Even a small technological object that could not be manufactured on Earth, or a smudge of complex organic material that is not based on DNA/protein/etc chemistry, could be convincing if it were examined in multiple laboratories around the world. &nbsp;Instead, we have endless subjective reports or unconvincing non-physical evidence. &nbsp; In this respect, UFOs resemble claims for parapsychology and ESP, sightings of Bigfoot, the Loch Ness monster, ghosts or (in past centuries) fairies and Leprechauns. We all like stories about imaginary creatures ... but adults generally don't believe they are real. &nbsp;</p>
<p><big><b>In summary, there is no credible or scientifically accepted evidence that alien life forms have visited Earth in recent times. However, `absence of evidence does not imply evidence of absence'; it is impossible to disprove the hypothesis that aliens visit Earth if the visits can leave no tangible evidence. In this sense, the alien UFO hypothesis is not a scientific theory -- it is not falsifiable. However, it is verifiable if any physical material (manufactured or biological) inconsistent with a terrestrial origin were produced associated with a UFO report.</b></big></p>
<h2>What might realistic alien visitors be like?</h2>
<p>From the Drake Equation and our discussion of interstellar spaceflight, we infer that it is possible that the Galaxy has spacefaring civilizations Let's think about what a scientifically plausible alien visit might be like:</p>
<ul><li>Very large and massive spaceship capable of v > 0.1 c (c = speed of light) travel and conditions to keep organisms alive for (say) 10<sup>4</sup> years. Fictional examples from Hollywood of really huge alien space ships include the mother ship in <i>Independence Day </i>and the underwater ship in <i>The Abyss</i>.</li><li>Spaceship must have more advanced technology than ours, but still obeying physical laws. No Warp Drives or other faster-than-light travel. Probably powered by nuclear fusion, black hole accretion or similar highly efficient energy source based on E=mc<sup>2</sup>. Ship likely to be heavily shielded against rocket emissions, cosmic rays and interstellar debris. Streamlined shapes are unnecessary.</li><li>Alien morphology unlike any on Earth. Not humanoid with two arms, two legs and head (e.g. in the movies <i>E.T., Close Encounters of the Third Kind, StarTrek,</i> etc). Not resembling insects, spiders, lobsters or octopi (e.g. H.G. Wells' <span style="font-style: italic;">War of the Worlds</span>, <i>Starship Troopers, Men in Black</i>). They could have any shape and (nearly) any size.</li><li>Alien visitors are unlikely to be elusive. They are on a one-way trip. If we were the alien visitors to another planet, it is almost certain that we would need to&nbsp;use resources from the new planet in order to continue to survive. &nbsp;If the planet already had other lifeforms on it (even microscopic), then there could be serious consequences for one or both civilizations. &nbsp;</li></ul>
