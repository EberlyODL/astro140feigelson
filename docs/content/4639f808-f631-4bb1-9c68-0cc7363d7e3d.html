<p><em><strong>This commentary accompanies Chapters 4 and 5 of our text, An Introduction to Astrobiology</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>Section 4.1: Introduction</strong></p>
<p>This is a long introduction to the outer icy moons of the Solar System that you do not have to read in great detail. &nbsp;I covered this on a simpler level in the <em>Review of the Solar System</em> class. &nbsp;The photos of the moons are excellent (Figures 4.4-7 and 4.10-12) as well as the models of their interiors (Figures 4.13-14). &nbsp;The surfaces show enormous variation: from ancient cratered ice to young smooth icy, to stange patterns from (re)melting episodes and volcanoes on Io. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I entirely agree with the first sentences of the chapter: &nbsp;prior to the fly-by missions of the Voyager probes in the 1980s, there was little expectation of liquids needed for life anywhere in the Solar System beyond Mars. The reason is simply temperature: the Sun's light is so faint at these distances that no body's surface can reach the melting temperature of water. &nbsp;Scientists expected that the moons would either be rocky like the asteroids, or icy with ancient frozen surfaces, showing only craters from many asteroid impacts. &nbsp;Jupiter's biggest moon, Callisto (Fig 4.10), is a good example of this, as well as many smaller Jovian moons. &nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left; ">It was thus a big surprise when Voyager found several moons with young, active surfaces, showing few impact craters. Understanding these moons was a major motivation for the complex and expensive missions of the 2000s: the NASA's Galileo probe, which orbited within Jupiter's system, and European Space Agency's (ESA's) Cassini mission that is still orbiting within Saturn's system. &nbsp;Jupiter's innermost moon, Io, nearly entirely melted by tidal stresses, has many active volcanoes that perpetually cover the surface with new material.</p>
<p style="text-align: left; "><strong>Section 4.2: Europa&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left; ">But it was Jupiter's moon Europa (and similarly, Ganymede) that seemed most relevant to the search for life in the Solar System. It has a water ice surface like Callisto, but very few craters. &nbsp;The reflective surface must have been melted and refrozen. &nbsp;The strange grooves, rough patches, and&nbsp;multicolored ice suggest that this melting is a recurrent process, not from a single violent event. Dark ice fills some grooves and patches on the surface (photo below and the many figures in the text). &nbsp;This suggests that the ice covering is not very thick, and liquid (or slushy) water lies below and wells up when the surface cracks. &nbsp;The rough patches on the surface (chaotic terrain) may be the product of ice plates grinding against each other, similar to mountain-building on Earth due to plate tectonics.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: left; ">This requires that Europa have a liquid water layer beneath a relatively thin ice crust. &nbsp;This is supported by the presence of a weak magnetic field around Europa. &nbsp;What keeps it above freezing temperature? &nbsp;Perhaps it is tidal forces (weaker than Io's) due to its slightly elliptical orbit and perturbations by other moons. &nbsp;Perhaps large impacts episodically melt the interior. &nbsp;The thickness of the ice crust and the water ocean is quite uncertain; below are two models for Europa's interior. &nbsp;NASA engineers and scientists have conceptually designed a mission that would land on Europa with a probe that would melt its way through the ice and swim in the hidden ocean. &nbsp;But this <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPCpNlVJBr8">ice-penetrating robot mission</a> has not been approved by NASA or Congress.</p>
<p style="text-align: left; "><b><i>Section 4.2 on Europa is 24 pages long, and you do not have to know it all. &nbsp;However, in Quiz #3 I will ask for a 1 paragraph essay about Europa's surface which you should prepare in advance from this section. &nbsp;Detailed information and explanation will be expected.</i></b></p>
<p style="text-align: left; "><strong>Section 4.5: Other icy moons</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left; ">Jupiter's moon Europa is not the only one that appears to have melted interior. &nbsp;Neptune's moon Triton is bizarre, half covered with an ancient cratered surface and have with a smooth uncratered surface. &nbsp;Perhaps it collided with another moon and partially melted. &nbsp;Saturn's moon Enceladus shows some craters, but also has discolorations and grooves. &nbsp;Here the Cassini probe has photographed geysers (essentially water volcanoes) along a long ridge. &nbsp;As with Europa, this can be explained only if the surface ice is relatively thin and a (partially) melted layer lies below. &nbsp;Here are some photos of Enceladus.</p>

<p style="text-align: left; "><strong>Chapter 5: Titan&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left; ">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="/_legacy/astro140/titan_cassini.jpg" style="text-align: center;" target="_blank"><img alt="Titan seen in visible light by the Cassini mission" class="lightbox" src="https://courses.ed.science.psu.edu/_legacy/astro140/titan_cassini.jpg" style="width: 276px;"></a><span style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</span><a href="/_legacy/astro140/titan_fulldisk_cassini.jpg" style="color: rgb(0, 98, 160); text-decoration: underline; text-align: center;" target="_blank"><img alt="Full disk of Saturn's moon Titan showing the surface in infrared light, photographed by the Cassini probe" class="lightbox" src="https://courses.ed.science.psu.edu/_legacy/astro140/titan_fulldisk_cassini.jpg" style="width: 345px;"></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left; ">We finally come to Saturn's moon Titan, the largest in the Solar System. &nbsp;It was already known from ground-based studies that it is the only moon with its own atmosphere, mostly nitrogen (N<sub>2</sub>) with some methane (CH<sub>4</sub>) and other hydrocarbons. &nbsp;Take a look at its spectrum in the infrared band shown in Figure 5.8, and recall our discussion early in the semester how different molecules have rotational and vibrational states defined by quantum mechanics. &nbsp;The complicated jagged spectral features are from transitions between these quantized states, and from the spectrum astrochemists can determine the composition of Titan's atmosphere. &nbsp;The answer is given in Table 5.3. &nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left; ">Section 5.3 then describes how many of these molecules can be formed from a simpler original composition of (say) methane. &nbsp;Some of the chemical reactions would commonly occur on Earth, such as the conbining of two methanes to form ethane (equation 5.5). &nbsp;But other reactions require more unusual molecules such as CH (equation 5.6). &nbsp;These arise when chemical bonds are broken by ultraviiolet light from the (rather faint and distant) Sun. &nbsp;Reactions involving CH lead to other rarer species such as ethene and ethyne (equation 5.6), and then long chain hydrocarbons (eequations 5.9-5.10). &nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left; ">Chemists know a lot about such molecules, including the pressures and temperatures where they are in gaseous, liquid or frozen states (see Box 3.3 on p. 92). The pressure and temperature structure of titan's atmosphere was directly measured by the Huyghens probe launched onto the surface by the Cassini satellite in 2005 (Figure 5.13). &nbsp;Combining laboratory &nbsp;measurements of these chemicals with the Titan atmosphere measurements, we find that methane (CH<sub>4</sub>) and ethane (C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>), which are in high abundance in the atmosphere, should be liquid at Titan's surface temperature and pressure. &nbsp;This explains why the Cassini mission found liquid streams and lakes on Titan: methane-ethane lakes evaporate, producing methane-ethane clouds that rain, forming streams that flow back into the lakes ... just like water on Earth has lakes and oceans that evaporate, produce rain that forms rivers that flow back into the oceans (section 5.4.1). &nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left; ">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<a href="/_legacy/astro140/titan_descent.jpg" style="text-align: center;" target="_blank"><img alt="Photo of methane streams on Titan, photographed by Cassini's Huyghens probe as it parachuted to the surface" src="https://courses.ed.science.psu.edu/_legacy/astro140/titan_descent.jpg" style="width: 276px;"></a>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><a href="/_legacy/astro140/titan_surface.png" style="color: rgb(0, 98, 160); text-decoration: underline; text-align: center;" target="_blank"><img alt="A photo from the surface of Titan showing rocks in a `muddy' soil (the liquid is probably methane)" class="lightbox" src="https://courses.ed.science.psu.edu/_legacy/astro140/titan_surface.png" style="width: 207px;"></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left; ">Thus, chemistry and astronomy together explain the remarkable liquids on Titan's surface. &nbsp;The surface cannot be seen in visible light due to the thick clouds, but the Huyghens probe took a few photos as it pararchuted onto the surface (section 5.4.3) and the orbiting Cassini satellite obtains detailed maps of the surface in infrared light and radar reflectance (section 5.4.4). &nbsp;I find these images to be totally amazing! &nbsp;On Earth, liquid methane is called LNG, liquified natural gas, and is used as a fuel. &nbsp;Titan seems to have a full climate with polar methane ice caps, methane clouds and rainstorms, rivers and lakes, and dunes. &nbsp;Cassini has traced a seasonal cycle involving warming with lake evaporation, and cooling with expanding ice caps. &nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left; ">Finally, our text explains that methane cannot survive long on Titan due to photodissociation (breaking apart) by solar ultraviolet (section 5.4.1). &nbsp;So there should be some source of methane to continuously replenish the atmosphere and lakes (section 5.4.5). &nbsp;One possibility, still not confirmed, is volcanoes releasing methane from the moon's interior. &nbsp;While we are not sure this is occurring, we do see cryovolcanoes (ice-volcanoes) on Neptune's moon Triton, and of course on Jupiter's Io.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left; "><strong>Life on Titan?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left; ">One can only speculate whether life can arise on Titan's surface where the temperature is around 90<sup>o</sup> K (ninety degrees above absolute zero). &nbsp;Recent laboratory experiments (similar to the Miller-Urey experiments for early Earth) indicate that amino acids and nucleic acids, critical components of proteins and DNA, could form if the temperature were hotter. &nbsp;Astronomers note that, in a few billion years, the Sun will become a red giant star, boiling water on Earth but warming Titan to more habitable temperatures. &nbsp;Altogether, after Earth, Titan seems to have the best chance for life in the Solar System with a solid surface, carbon-rich chemistry, a liquid solvent, and ecological variety. &nbsp;NASA recently approved funds for preliminary study of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titan_Mare_Explorer">Titan Mare Explorer</a> that would splash-land in one of its methane lakes and study its chemistry. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>We thus find that, contrary to any reasonable expectation before detailed study with robotic probes, that some Jovian moons have liquid on (or close to) their surfaces. &nbsp;Europa and similar moons have water oceans below their ice coverings, and Titan has incredible liquid hydrocarbon lakes on its surface.</p>
<p>It is likely that, in coming decades, humans will send more probes to the icy moons of the outer Solar System to study them further ... and look for primitive live forms.&nbsp;</p>
