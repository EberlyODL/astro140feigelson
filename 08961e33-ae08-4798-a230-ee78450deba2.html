<p>Welcome to the first theme of&nbsp;the course. There are three topics for this unit:</p>
<ul><li><a href="https://courses.ed.science.psu.edu/astro140/node/490">How do we study life in the Universe</a>?</li><li><a href="https://courses.ed.science.psu.edu/astro140/node/494">Cosmology: The History of the Universe</a></li><li><a href="https://courses.ed.science.psu.edu/astro140/node/498">Stars: Energy for Life</a></li></ul>
<p>The unit will be completed over two&nbsp;weeks of the course. &nbsp;Except for some historical background, this&nbsp;is intended primarily to&nbsp;review&nbsp;material you covered in a previous introductory astronomy class, with some particular focus on ideas most relevant to the emergence of life in the Universe. &nbsp;If this material is new to you, then please devote extra time to this theme. &nbsp;</p>
